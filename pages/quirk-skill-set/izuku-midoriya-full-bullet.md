For me what is hardest to live with is the difference in skill. Why I, with the sorriest aim, am put in the same lobby as ZEN Thunderkyle (made up name) who uses Strike Deku and has more aim than I have debts? Like I be gammaing with compress and the mf be shooting me out of the marble when it's already flying in the air.

Oh, but when you down him for some miraculous reason like perfect third party timing, they get ressed by a toad or a ferrari legboi.

SPEAKING OF, why does Deku (and by extent, Iida and All Might) have a res passive that has zero cooldown and infinite uses with a fairly quick pick up animation?

Oh, and now be prepared for max tuning red deku, you better not guard break him in plus ultra, or else be ready to see his alpha doing 200 DMG per shot with Revenge Strike + 40 dmg amplifying slots, because this game isn't ready for such massive damage output.

If you are a red deku that consistently hits 10 KOs a game, CHILL, why do I always have to deal with the most determined red deku? The match be starting and lil doo be stalking me across the whole map, like I swear I was one time playing as Hawks and we were at mall, and I had to fly real quick to UA building... THE MAN WAS FOLLOWING ME, ALL THE WAY FROM MALL, WITH RED DEKU, LIKE CHILL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT LOSING AGGRO MEANS?

"Well if they get the kill it's worth it"

Look my boi imma smack your noggin' until it looks like Arby's fries

"Skill Issue, get better"

MY MAN YOU DONT GET TO THAT LEVEL IN 5 DAYS OF PRACTICE, THAT'S A WHOLE AHH UNI DEGREE OF ITS OWN, HAVE YOU SEEN MY AIM? An Uraraka was climbing a building one day and I threw a Bakugo grenade at her

I missed.

YOU OVERESTIMATE MY MOTOR SKILLS

ALSO

Even if I became the real pigment, WHAT ABOUT MY TEAMMATES

Somehow, these teams with the 10 KO red deku have two teammates that are perfectly in sync, they somehow manage to be close together and attack the same person at the same time and still get teamheals from heaven or something, like h o w, no matter if I do solo Q or with friends, we always get split apart at some point because we gotta flee from conflict and heal. I swear to go-

Oh but hey, now with the new tuning sheet, these dekus can get HP and GP back with each down... how cool! Even cooler if you're a Hawks thirdpartying the sheet of everyone with alpha!

Now to keep up I gotta make use of this tuning sheet, but there is a problem...

⭐Tuning is trash❤️ (mostly)

You love your sick menacing All For One? or your super cute Nejire? well what a shame, because their tuning is probably garbo! But hey! Do not worry! Because their ugly ahh recolor has some sick slots! Why rock the drip when you can rock the smack!

Like come on, if you need to make skins affect the meta just play Dangerous Quirk Fusion Overhaul, that shee so horrendous they had to censor it in China (not actually, at least yet).

Oh! But rarity also matters, because not only the max level of tuning is much lower, you also have more slots locked behind keys! Speaking of...

WHY THEY SO EXPENSIVE? Like I swear it's cheaper to buy an iPhone, at this rate Bitcoin will die and the new crypto will be the friggin ultra rumble keys, 200 hero souls to unlock 1 slot? you donkey-

What if my main is Mic? who has no PUR skin (and no Ultra Rumble original gallery image mind you), or Cementoss, Mt Lady and Ibara who only have like 2 sets of skins?

and for the love of god fix the reward freeze bug, and training mode, and overall the whole game like let me tell you something... Today I was checking the japanese account's twitter, and one of the replies to one of their posts said (in japanese) "If you dont like tuning, I recommend playing in CPU mode, the characters are cute and it's easier to win."

Like

Truer words were never spoken before (the rest of the comments were just about Hawks, the usual)

You know what's the biggest flaw of tuning? the fact that you can't open byking's tuning and max Decision Making+ and Content+

Gotta love Balance- and Cashgrab+
