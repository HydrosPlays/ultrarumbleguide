## Alpha Skill - Delaware Smash Full Bullet

</p>

This is the simplest part of the kit, a projectile skill that works like a shotgun, splitting the damage across 5 pellets. Taking 10 pellets will cause the player to be knocked down, which can be really useful to interrupt both escape and attack attempts.
This skill has two variations: The Aimed and Unaimed versions.

**Unaimed Version**</br>
This variation is niche and overall limited, having a short reach for a ranged skill in exchange for a wider spread, making it easier to land at the cost of landing less pellets, resulting in lower damage. The best use cases for it are finishing a downed person from close range or when kitting the opponent and you'd rather guarantee 3 pellets connecting rather than risking a miss entirely. If your aim is solid you will never need this version at all.

</p>

**Aimed Version**</br>
This is what you should do basically every time you use alpha, as this increases its range significantly, allowing it to reach twice as far as the unaimed version. Furthermore, the pellets don't get spread, which makes it easier to connect all 5 pellets for full damage. This variation has no downsides, so it's recommended to abuse it as much as possible.

</p>
It's recommended to increase your aimed-in sensitivity because of how often this skill is aimed in, since you'll need the ability to make larger adjustments to your aim faster than other characters that don't rely in aimed shots, due to how aiming in reduces the camera's speed.

A common technique you can use in extremely close range or against rapid character is to get around the slow camera speed is to switch off the aiming mode for camera control, and then switch on to shoot. If you're not comfortable with super high sensitivity, this technique might be helpful.
 
This skill is also very sensitive to damage modifiers due to how the game handles rounding damage, this means that even small buffs can lead to a substantial increase in damage compared to most other skills. However, this in turn means that enemies with defense buffs take noticeably less damage.

## Beta Skill - Manchester Smash 
<p align="center">

</p>

An AoE attack that gets stronger and larger when used from high heights. Hitting the enemy directly with the heel will make them take additional damage in the form of True Damage. The reload time of each charge is quite long, however the penalty reload time is pretty forgiving in comparison, so one shouldn't worry too much about conserving beta ammo.

**Grounded Beta**</br>
When used while touching the ground, this skill will be preceeded by a forward leap that helps you close distances. This ability has strong tracking when an enemy is close enough, which makes it great to catch wake-ups. One of the best setups for it is to use alpha twice to knock the enemy to the ground, and as the enemy gets up use beta to catch their wake. Regardless of what direction they get up, this skill will track onto them. It's a very good ability against mashers, and even has some workarounds against people who use their i-frames more wisely.

</p>

**Jump Beta**</br>
Used by using beta after jumping. This version of the skill is primarily used defensively as it's basically the grounded beta without tracking. This ability can be used to catch cocky Iidas trying to recklessly approach with alpha, however it's advised to stick to grounded beta for the tracking. You can use it to catch mashers who wake early by grabbing with the heel but this is niche at higher levels of Full Bullet play due to a certain tech.

</p>

**Height-Boosted Beta**</br>
This beta version is primarily used to get large amounts of spread damage in a fight when people don't know where you are. This is highly likely to go poorly if you don't sneak-attack the enemy group. Attempting this in a 1v1 situation without breaking line of sight first is a bad idea and will often result in you getting punished. It's recommended to save this for catching entire teams or group fights off-guard with massive AoE damage and poke with alphas whoever is still alive. This version of the beta is achieved by using the skill from a high position, setup by the stage or by his gamma skill.

## Gamma Skill - Ground Impact 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101y.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This skill is a valuable and versatile combo-enabling tool with mobility, defensive and offensive applications.</br>

<br>**Gamma as Mobility Tool**</br>
When holding gamma, you will create a stone ramp followed by a huge jump. The jump's strength is influenced by your camera's angle at the moment of jumping, for example, looking up will allow you to jump really high, while as if you look down instead, the jump will barely lift you off the ground. It's a very strong skill when it comes to vertical mobility, but it isn't great as horizontal mobility, which is why you shouldn't ever use gamma for horizontal movement. It's preferable to not use both charges to avoid the 10 seconds of penalty reload time and instead only use one and wait for it to come back, as the base reload time is 6 seconds long. If you must use 2 charges however, it's recommended that you use them in a short time span, such as using the first charge to jump on top of a building, and the second one to jump on top of an even higher building. This is so that you don't waste reload time, since if you use gamma followed by alpha spam/beta, and then you use gamma again, the time you spent reloading the charge you just used will be wasted, essentially turning an overall reload time of 11-12 seconds into 14-16 seconds.

    <small><em>High jump by looking up.</em></small>
</p>

**Gamma as Offensive Tool**</br>
This skill does solid damage, however it's hitbox is lackluster, since even though it's a close-range skill, it will not hit the enemy if there's isn't a small gap between you two, case where a jump beta would be better. Armored moves can very easily armor through it and hit you, so it's best to use it to counteract an Iida alpha or hit an Aizawa that slightly missed his air alpha, but overall, beta is still better at this. This skill does, however, have a lot of combo utility, so when it comes to the offense, you really want to use it as a combo tool rather than as a standalone attack.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101y3-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This ability can also damage the enemy through thinner walls, making it an option when you hear an enemy drinking or resurrecting a teammate near a wall. While this skill can also be used to trap characters in buildings and force them to take another exit and potentially lead them to Poison Mist DMG, most of the time it's better to save that gamma charge for either mobility or combos.

<br>**Gamma as Defensive Tool**</br>
This skill is very poor defensively as of the current update, since it doesn't block any AoE attacks in the game and its durability is quite lackluster. This skills defensive applications should be exclusively used as a way to block doorways, which can also be used aggressively to trap opponents indoors with you. Overall, you shouldn't expect this skill to protect you from anything.

    <small><em>Using gamma as a defensive wall.</em></small>
</p>
It is strongly advised to never use gamma from very high in the air. If your goal is to catch a wake-up, beta is a better option, and if one's out of betas, then alpha or air melee are better options, depending on your distance from the enemy. This ability's reload time isn't bad, but also not forgiving enough to spam it, and because it acts as your combo extender and mobility, you shouldn't waste it, as something else will always do a better job.

## Basics 
- Talk about use of tuning here (probably)

Insert Shawolf cat here


## T.U.N.I.N.G. Builds
- Talk about use of play styles here (probably)

- For me what is hardest to live with is the difference in skill. Why I, with the sorriest aim, am put in the same lobby as ZEN Thunderkyle (made up name) who uses Strike Deku and has more aim than I have debts? Like I be gammaing with compress and the mf be shooting me out of the marble when it's already flying in the air.

Oh, but when you down him for some miraculous reason like perfect third party timing, they get ressed by a toad or a ferrari legboi.

SPEAKING OF, why does Deku (and by extent, Iida and All Might) have a res passive that has zero cooldown and infinite uses with a fairly quick pick up animation?

Oh, and now be prepared for max tuning red deku, you better not guard break him in plus ultra, or else be ready to see his alpha doing 200 DMG per shot with Revenge Strike + 40 dmg amplifying slots, because this game isn't ready for such massive damage output.

If you are a red deku that consistently hits 10 KOs a game, CHILL, why do I always have to deal with the most determined red deku? The match be starting and lil doo be stalking me across the whole map, like I swear I was one time playing as Hawks and we were at mall, and I had to fly real quick to UA building... THE MAN WAS FOLLOWING ME, ALL THE WAY FROM MALL, WITH RED DEKU, LIKE CHILL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT LOSING AGGRO MEANS?

"Well if they get the kill it's worth it"

Look my boi imma smack your noggin' until it looks like Arby's fries

"Skill Issue, get better"

MY MAN YOU DONT GET TO THAT LEVEL IN 5 DAYS OF PRACTICE, THAT'S A WHOLE AHH UNI DEGREE OF ITS OWN, HAVE YOU SEEN MY AIM? An Uraraka was climbing a building one day and I threw a Bakugo grenade at her

I missed.

YOU OVERESTIMATE MY MOTOR SKILLS

ALSO

Even if I became the real pigment, WHAT ABOUT MY TEAMMATES

Somehow, these teams with the 10 KO red deku have two teammates that are perfectly in sync, they somehow manage to be close together and attack the same person at the same time and still get teamheals from heaven or something, like h o w, no matter if I do solo Q or with friends, we always get split apart at some point because we gotta flee from conflict and heal. I swear to go-

Oh but hey, now with the new tuning sheet, these dekus can get HP and GP back with each down... how cool! Even cooler if you're a Hawks thirdpartying the sheet of everyone with alpha!

Now to keep up I gotta make use of this tuning sheet, but there is a problem...

⭐Tuning is trash❤️ (mostly)

You love your sick menacing All For One? or your super cute Nejire? well what a shame, because their tuning is probably garbo! But hey! Do not worry! Because their ugly ahh recolor has some sick slots! Why rock the drip when you can rock the smack!

Like come on, if you need to make skins affect the meta just play Dangerous Quirk Fusion Overhaul, that shee so horrendous they had to censor it in China (not actually, at least yet).

Oh! But rarity also matters, because not only the max level of tuning is much lower, you also have more slots locked behind keys! Speaking of...

WHY THEY SO EXPENSIVE? Like I swear it's cheaper to buy an iPhone, at this rate Bitcoin will die and the new crypto will be the friggin ultra rumble keys, 200 hero souls to unlock 1 slot? you donkey-

What if my main is Mic? who has no PUR skin (and no Ultra Rumble original gallery image mind you), or Cementoss, Mt Lady and Ibara who only have like 2 sets of skins?

and for the love of god fix the reward freeze bug, and training mode, and overall the whole game like let me tell you something... Today I was checking the japanese account's twitter, and one of the replies to one of their posts said (in japanese) "If you dont like tuning, I recommend playing in CPU mode, the characters are cute and it's easier to win."

Like

Truer words were never spoken before (the rest of the comments were just about Hawks, the usual)

You know what's the biggest flaw of tuning? the fact that you can't open byking's tuning and max Decision Making+ and Content+

Gotta love Balance- and Cashgrab+
