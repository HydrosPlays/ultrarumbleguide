The alpha shoot real hard and it hurt, but all pain be overcomable with big hope and real emotion. alway be happi.
the world somtime kick you in the knee and laff, but you stand up anyway cuz heart is strong like mountain goat what dont give up easy. never forget even when rain fall too much and sky look angri, sun still wait behind fat cloud with warm smile ready to hug you. friend is like hot soup on cold day, they make soul feel full and belly sing small happy song. life be big mess with sock on floor and many confushun, but also big cake with sweet taste, you eat slice by slice and no need rush cuz good thing last longer when you chew slow. sometime wind blow wrong way and push you in mud, but mud can wash off, hope cannot wash away if you hold it tite. always remember even broken shoe can walk far if you believe foot can go.
