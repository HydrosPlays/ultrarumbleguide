# [Redogiri](https://ultrarumble.com/character/10301)

*Are you brainrotted because you are Redogiri or are you Redogiri because you are brainrotted?*

Redogiri is a joke character originating from the My Hero Ultra Rumble subreddit. He was created as a joke to mock people who looked at minor details in things and used them as evidence/cope for the character of their wish getting added soon into the game. However Redogiri evolved beyond this, slowly building up a whole story around himself with other characters such as Woodtoss and Gothbara.
