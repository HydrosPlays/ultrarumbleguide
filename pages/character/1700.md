## Alpha Skill - Arson 

<p align="center">

</p>

This ability allows Dabi to fire a slow homing projectile towards the opponent that inflicts the Blue Fire status, dealing damage over time (DoT). It's mainly used as a pressure tool, as a nuisance so to speak. Due to its slow tracking, unlike most alphas you cannot use it at a distance, or to snipe opponents. So the best way to utilize this is by shooting at a general direction from the backline while your team fights an enemy team. This will do a few things:<br>
<br>
1. The enemy will not only have to fight off your team, but they will also have to watch out for these slow, homing fireballs, so they will constantly be dodging or blocking (for the likes of Kendo and Red Drive's beta skills), and this will create openings for your team.
2. Even when they think they got away from the main fight (especially if you have your Î± maxed) they do travel quite a bit so it may catch them off guard and they'll be on the lookout.
3. These alphas cause no practical knockdown, so if the enemy is stunned or unaware of you, you can get in a solid 3-4 hits before they realize what's happening and make a counter play.

This alpha is also good for recon in a sense. If you just toss it out and someone is close by behind a corner, or in a bush, this will track them and hit them, thus revealing their location. 

Below level 4, the range, size, and tracking is pretty sub-par, which is why its best to get it to level 4 at the start. The reason you want to level this up last is because this is the worst ability in his kit. However it is useful to have it at least at level 4 to assist the team and sometimes catch opponents running away. 
<p align="center">

</p>

Dabi has a trick to using his alpha. Instead of just spamming your alpha, you want to dash and then jump and shoot at the same time. Once you hit the ground, you will automatically dash, which will allow you to repeat this process. This trick allows you to shoot faster while keeping yourself agile, and once one gets the timing, it will come naturally.

## Beta Skill - Shadow Fire
<p align="center">

</p>

Arguably Dabi's best tool, this ability allows Dabi to set traps that trigger a flame pillar when an enemy gets too close, they can also be placed midair. 
Even though both your allies and you can see the trap from far away, these remain invisible for the enemy until you're almost on top of them, so it makes them a great tool to use in and outside of battle. You can have up to 5 at a time on the map and each trap does 4 ticks of damage before the enemy gets knocked down. These traps can stun enemies without GP, making them unable to act the moment they start taking damage.

</p>
<br>

**Blocking Projectiles**<br>
Beta can also be used to block a projectile for one hit or to counter/trade a close range attack (such as an Iida rushing in, or a non-hardened mode Assault Kirishima using his own beta). If the enemy has a traveling armored move (such as Shigaraki's gamma or All Might's beta), the enemy will only take 2 hits of damage and fly through the trap. This is true if the trap is on the ground or in the air.

</p>
<br>

**Smart Traps**<br>
The traps are best used as actual traps. When not in a fight, place them around the map in certain locations such as doorways, hallways, alleys, narrow paths, known healing locations, ramps, jump pads... The possibilities are endless. 
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1700b3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

<br>

**Recon Tool**<br>
Always play around your traps in a fight, do not just toss them out and move the fight elsewhere, the idea is to bait the enemy to come to you, so always play around them. The best use for these outside of combat is also the ability to know where an enemy is. When rescuing civilians (or using them as bait) you can always place a trap on a civilian and wait for when you see and hear DMG numbers pop up. If you know where it was coming from you can be certain that it was that trap you placed on the civilian and thus know the enemy's location.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1700b7-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The other thing you must always do after a fight is place a trap where the enemies body was after you KO them. This will cause their ally to trigger the trap when they go to retrieve their badge. If you play Dabi you must get into this habit. 

<br>

**Finisher**<br>
If the enemy has an insta-rez character on their team, 3 traps is all it will take to finish an enemy. Each trap does an additional tick of damage to DOWN'd enemies.

## Gamma Skill - Ring of Fire
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch017_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This skill is a valuable and versatile combo-enabling tool with mobility, defensive and offensive applications.</br>

<br>**Gamma as Mobility Tool**</br>
When holding gamma, you will create a stone ramp followed by a huge jump. The jump's strength is influenced by your camera's angle at the moment of jumping, for example, looking up will allow you to jump really high, while as if you look down instead, the jump will barely lift you off the ground. It's a very strong skill when it comes to vertical mobility, but it isn't great as horizontal mobility, which is why you shouldn't ever use gamma for horizontal movement. It's preferable to not use both charges to avoid the 10 seconds of penalty reload time and instead only use one and wait for it to come back, as the base reload time is 6 seconds long. If you must use 2 charges however, it's recommended that you use them in a short time span, such as using the first charge to jump on top of a building, and the second one to jump on top of an even higher building. This is so that you don't waste reload time, since if you use gamma followed by alpha spam/beta, and then you use gamma again, the time you spent reloading the charge you just used will be wasted, essentially turning an overall reload time of 11-12 seconds into 14-16 seconds.

    <small><em>High jump by looking up.</em></small>
</p>

**Gamma as Offensive Tool**</br>
This skill does solid damage, however it's hitbox is lackluster, since even though it's a close-range skill, it will not hit the enemy if there's isn't a small gap between you two, case where a jump beta would be better. Armored moves can very easily armor through it and hit you, so it's best to use it to counteract an Iida alpha or hit an Aizawa that slightly missed his air alpha, but overall, beta is still better at this. This skill does, however, have a lot of combo utility, so when it comes to the offense, you really want to use it as a combo tool rather than as a standalone attack.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101y3-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This ability can also damage the enemy through thinner walls, making it an option when you hear an enemy drinking or resurrecting a teammate near a wall. While this skill can also be used to trap characters in buildings and force them to take another exit and potentially lead them to Poison Mist DMG, most of the time it's better to save that gamma charge for either mobility or combos.

<br>**Gamma as Defensive Tool**</br>
This skill is very poor defensively as of the current update, since it doesn't block any AoE attacks in the game and its durability is quite lackluster. This skills defensive applications should be exclusively used as a way to block doorways, which can also be used aggressively to trap opponents indoors with you. Overall, you shouldn't expect this skill to protect you from anything.

    <small><em>Using gamma as a defensive wall.</em></small>
</p>
It is strongly advised to never use gamma from very high in the air. If your goal is to catch a wake-up, beta is a better option, and if one's out of betas, then alpha or air melee are better options, depending on your distance from the enemy. This ability's reload time isn't bad, but also not forgiving enough to spam it, and because it acts as your combo extender and mobility, you shouldn't waste it, as something else will always do a better job.

## Special Action - Unquenchable Flame
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch017.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that allows you to save your downed teammates by carrying them and help them get up. It's a limited ability that can come handy from time to time.
After picking up a teammate, this skill has two parts: Carrying and Dropping.

<br>**Carrying**</br>
While carrying, you will be able to reposition your downed teammate. It's strongly recommended to never carry your ally elsewhere, as you're left without any means of defending yourself, becoming a damage sponge, which on top of that can knock your ally out of your back, preventing your teammate from getting-up and wasting health and potentially leading to both your death and your teammate's death. The only scenario where you could carry your ally is if they died in the Poison Mist and there are no enemies around to attack you.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

<br>**Dropping**</br>
Immediately after picking up your downed teammate, you want to drop them as soon as possible. This allows you to get your teammate back up instantly and allow you to keep fighting right away, however it's still really risky, as the time it takes you to pick up and ally and drop them is enough for any good player to take away half your health. The only context where you should use it in a fight is when you or your other teammate manage to create a window in which you can safely pick and drop your downed teammate, such as when you knock down the enemy with 2 alphas or, in open fights, after knocking everyone away with beta. The Special Action's whole gauge has a 1 second reload time, so in practice it has no cooldown.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 4-string combo chain with low range and somewhat slow endlag. This should be a last resort option, since Full Bullet excels at short range but not quite point blank, so if an enemy gets close enough to get hit by melee then it's likely you or/and your enemy made a mistake, since at peak levels of Full Bullet this will never come into play.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This move is usually fairly bad on Full Bullet but it has a few key advantages. Firstly, it's fast, very fast, and because of this, you can often use it to commbo-break against grapple characters like Aizawa and Tamaki that can get a bit greedy with their combos. Secondly, it has very little endlag. Unlike its ground counterpart where no matter when you stop you will be left vulnerable to punishing, his air melee doesn't have this issue, and instantly cancels all endlag upon touching the ground, so it ends up being better than the ground variation.

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
Ideal for individuals with good aim, a path that makes the best use out of your alpha from the very beginning, recommended path for anyone not interested in beta-cancelling. Just stay in the backline and shoot alphas.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/a9b4y4b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### All-Rounder Path
This path gives access to beta cancels immediately, which opens up the combo game almost entirely and gives significantly increased survivability in the melee game due to beta cancels massively reducing beta endlag.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/b4a9y4b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### Melee Path
An alternative for those uninterested in aiming. However, this path is the worst of the three, as alpha levels contribute significantly to Full Bullet's raw damage, so it's hard to ignore them for so long.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/b4y4a9b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### Why is Gamma Lvl.4 recommended before Beta Lvl.9?
A third beta is nice, but often redundant as 2 allow you to do most things well, meanwhile, the size increase at Gamma Lvl.4 is very good at blocking doorways and making raw gamma viable.

### What about Gamma Lvl.9?
At Lvl.9, Gamma doesn't change most interactions even though it gets bigger, that's why it's recommended to instead lend the level cards to trusted teammates instead if you're at Alpha Lvl.9, Beta Lvl.4-9 and Gamma Lvl.4, especially if they're falling behind level-wise.

## Techs
### Hop Gamma
An optimization you can do is to perform a short hop + Gamma, as the grouned Gamma animation is actually slower than the jump startup animation and air Gamma animation combined. It's a minor optimization, but it has more uses in combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta Canceling
This way of using beta and gamma is extremely potent. This tech is performed by using beta right after having used another beta. By default, this skill has noticeable endlag, however beta can be used again before the
endlag is over. While starting the leap animation for the second beta, you can immediately cancel the whole animation for the second beta and perform a gamma instead. This is much faster than waiting for the endlag and perform a gamma after. The primary use of this tech is for combos, as many rely on Beta Canceling to work, however, it's also incredibly useful for Full Bullet's survival, as it reduces the punishing window for his beta, which usually leaves you defenseless for a second. With this not only you make yourself less vulnerable, but also allows you to position yourself better and follow up with alphas or another beta if the later is level 9.
This tech can only be used at Beta level 4 or above, as the canceling requires a second beta.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage. DMG displayed from all level 1 to all level 9.

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Beta (Heel)
A basic yet strong combo that's only really viable near a wall or low ceiling, as otherwise people can easily avoid the second beta by waking early. The combo only works on HP.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c0-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c0.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
A simple combo consisting of the first two melees, followed by a gamma that will push the enemy forward, and that you will be able to catch with a beta after jumping. This combo can be followed by a beta cancel, but it's outclassed by other combos. The 1-2 melee into gamma can miss on GP, but even though it's really hard to, the beta can technically land.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c1-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c1.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Dash Jump -> Gamma -> Alpha 
A fairly easy combo that works on both GP and HP and takes advantage of the Hop Gamma tech, but that has the downsides of trapping your opponents inside the gamma and expend both of your gamma charges, leaving you grounded. The combo leaves room for a second alpha, but due to the high downpower buildup, the damage will be minimal, so it's best to save that charge.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c2-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c2.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma
A combo that works on both HP and GP. It's a mildly demanding combo, requiring two beta charges and fast inputs to not miss the gamma. Additionally, the beta can send the enemy in directions that might make it difficult or impossible to land the gamma. It's recommended to aim the gamma to the left of where beta connected, as that's the direction where the beta will send the enemy. 
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c3.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (No Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma
A variation of the Beta into Beta Cancel into Gamma combo with lower damage that requires very specific positioning and doesn't work well up slopes, but follow ups are possible, especially with a wall. It can be used to catch people with i-frames, as they will often burn their i-frames to punish beta's endlag, letting the gamma connect.t
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c4.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma -> Gamma -> Alpha
An incredibly strong combo that can destroy the enemy's health. This combo is only really worth indoors, as using it outdoors will often miss due to the second gamma sending the opponent too far away.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c5-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c5.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
Another really strong combo that has the possibility of a follow up with alpha for an extra 24-40 DMG, but this follow up can be avoided by the enemy. For it to work, GP has to be broken with the second gamma or earlier. This combo can be made more consistent if the enemy is to your left or your right and by slightly angling the second gamma away from them. If your internet or server connection is bad, the first gamma should be followed by a dash jump into gamma instead of going to it, as this way you can save frames thanks to the Hop Gamma tech.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c6-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c6.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Dash Jump -> Gamma -> Beta
A variation of the Gamma into Gamma Hold into Beta combo. It gets outclassed by the previous version. Angling the second gamma makes it more consistent, and you can use alpha as a follow up, but the enemy can avoid it with an early wake.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c6.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
An extremely powerful combo that makes use of all 3 beta charges, for this reason, beta level 9 is mandatory to execute this combo. Performing this combo isn't very difficult if you're surroundings are open enough, and it can be made easier if you angle gamma to the sides. This combo has no follow up.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c8-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c8.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Ending Note
In any combo that ends with gamma you can choose to hold the gamma, which leads to a 50/50 where, if the opponent doesn't wake early you can land a free alpha, and if they do, you can come down with beta and catch the wake-up. Depending on the ammo you have leftover, full follow ups are possible here, as the wake resets downpower.

The best use case for this fit is to act like the previous fit in many ways but it's recommended to only run it with Wall Runner and Revenge Strike, unless you don't have the previous skin, then you can use this fit with Card Duplication or GP Sucker and it will be almost as good.<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-hero.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-villain.png" width="30"> |

The regular tunes are slightly worse than all the other fits, but the main benefit here is the special tunes.<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-villain.png" width="30"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30"> |
