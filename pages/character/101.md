# [Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet)](https://ultrarumble.com/character/1#Variant-1)

Izuku Midoriya - Full bullet is an all-rounder character that excels at catching wake-ups. He differs from the average all-rounder by providing different utility in the form of inturuption with his alpha knockdown and beta grab. His burst damage is notably high at all ranges but he lacks armor and often struggles with mobility and survivability.

## Alpha Skill - Delaware Smash Full Bullet 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101a.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

This is the simplest part of the kit, a projectile skill that works like a shotgun, splitting the damage across 5 pellets. Taking 10 pellets will cause the player to be knocked down, which can be really useful to interrupt both escape and attack attempts.
This skill has two variations: The Aimed and Unaimed versions.

**Unaimed Version**</br>
This variation is niche and overall limited, having a short reach for a ranged skill in exchange for a wider spread, making it easier to land at the cost of landing less pellets, resulting in lower damage. The best use cases for it are finishing a downed person from close range or when kitting the opponent and you'd rather guarantee 3 pellets connecting rather than risking a miss entirely. If your aim is solid you will never need this version at all.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101a-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

**Aimed Version**</br>
This is what you should do basically every time you use alpha, as this increases its range significantly, allowing it to reach twice as far as the unaimed version. Furthermore, the pellets don't get spread, which makes it easier to connect all 5 pellets for full damage. This variation has no downsides, so it's recommended to abuse it as much as possible.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101a2-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
It's recommended to increase your aimed-in sensitivity because of how often this skill is aimed in, since you'll need the ability to make larger adjustments to your aim faster than other characters that don't rely in aimed shots, due to how aiming in reduces the camera's speed.

A common technique you can use in extremely close range or against rapid character is to get around the slow camera speed is to switch off the aiming mode for camera control, and then switch on to shoot. If you're not comfortable with super high sensitivity, this technique might be helpful.
 
This skill is also very sensitive to damage modifiers due to how the game handles rounding damage, this means that even small buffs can lead to a substantial increase in damage compared to most other skills. However, this in turn means that enemies with defense buffs take noticeably less damage.

## Beta Skill - Manchester Smash 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101b.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

An AoE attack that gets stronger and larger when used from high heights. Hitting the enemy directly with the heel will make them take additional damage in the form of True Damage. The reload time of each charge is quite long, however the penalty reload time is pretty forgiving in comparison, so one shouldn't worry too much about conserving beta ammo.

**Grounded Beta**</br>
When used while touching the ground, this skill will be preceeded by a forward leap that helps you close distances. This ability has strong tracking when an enemy is close enough, which makes it great to catch wake-ups. One of the best setups for it is to use alpha twice to knock the enemy to the ground, and as the enemy gets up use beta to catch their wake. Regardless of what direction they get up, this skill will track onto them. It's a very good ability against mashers, and even has a [tech](#beta-canceling) against people who use their i-frames more wisely.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101b-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

**Jump Beta**</br>
Used by using beta after jumping. This version of the skill is primarily used defensively as it's basically the grounded beta without tracking. This ability can be used to catch cocky Iidas trying to recklessly approach with alpha, however it's advised to stick to grounded beta for the tracking. You can use it to catch mashers who wake early by grabbing with the heel but this is niche at higher levels of Full Bullet play due to a certain tech.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101b2-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

**Height-Boosted Beta**</br>
This beta version is primarily used to get large amounts of spread damage in a fight when people don't know where you are. This is highly likely to go poorly if you don't sneak-attack the enemy group. Attempting this in a 1v1 situation without breaking line of sight first is a bad idea and will often result in you getting punished. It's recommended to save this for catching entire teams or group fights off-guard with massive AoE damage and poke with alphas whoever is still alive. This version of the beta is achieved by using the skill from a high position, setup by the stage or by his gamma skill.

## Gamma Skill - Ground Impact 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101y.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This skill is a valuable and versatile combo-enabling tool with mobility, defensive and offensive applications.</br>

<br>**Gamma as Mobility Tool**</br>
When holding gamma, you will create a stone ramp followed by a huge jump. The jump's strength is influenced by your camera's angle at the moment of jumping, for example, looking up will allow you to jump really high, while as if you look down instead, the jump will barely lift you off the ground. It's a very strong skill when it comes to vertical mobility, but it isn't great as horizontal mobility, which is why you shouldn't ever use gamma for horizontal movement. It's preferable to not use both charges to avoid the 10 seconds of penalty reload time and instead only use one and wait for it to come back, as the base reload time is 6 seconds long. If you must use 2 charges however, it's recommended that you use them in a short time span, such as using the first charge to jump on top of a building, and the second one to jump on top of an even higher building. This is so that you don't waste reload time, since if you use gamma followed by alpha spam/beta, and then you use gamma again, the time you spent reloading the charge you just used will be wasted, essentially turning an overall reload time of 11-12 seconds into 14-16 seconds.

    <small><em>High jump by looking up.</em></small>
</p>

**Gamma as Offensive Tool**</br>
This skill does solid damage, however it's hitbox is lackluster, since even though it's a close-range skill, it will not hit the enemy if there's isn't a small gap between you two, case where a jump beta would be better. Armored moves can very easily armor through it and hit you, so it's best to use it to counteract an Iida alpha or hit an Aizawa that slightly missed his air alpha, but overall, beta is still better at this. This skill does, however, have a lot of combo utility, so when it comes to the offense, you really want to use it as a combo tool rather than as a standalone attack.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101y3-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This ability can also damage the enemy through thinner walls, making it an option when you hear an enemy drinking or resurrecting a teammate near a wall. While this skill can also be used to trap characters in buildings and force them to take another exit and potentially lead them to Poison Mist DMG, most of the time it's better to save that gamma charge for either mobility or combos.

<br>**Gamma as Defensive Tool**</br>
This skill is very poor defensively as of the current update, since it doesn't block any AoE attacks in the game and its durability is quite lackluster. This skills defensive applications should be exclusively used as a way to block doorways, which can also be used aggressively to trap opponents indoors with you. Overall, you shouldn't expect this skill to protect you from anything.
<p align="center">

    <small><em>Using gamma as a defensive wall.</em></small>
</p>
It is strongly advised to never use gamma from very high in the air. If your goal is to catch a wake-up, beta is a better option, and if one's out of betas, then alpha or air melee are better options, depending on your distance from the enemy. This ability's reload time isn't bad, but also not forgiving enough to spam it, and because it acts as your combo extender and mobility, you shouldn't waste it, as something else will always do a better job.

## Special Action - Carry to Safety
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/100s.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that allows you to save your downed teammates by carrying them and help them get up. It's a limited ability that can come handy from time to time.
After picking up a teammate, this skill has two parts: Carrying and Dropping.

<br>**Carrying**</br>
While carrying, you will be able to reposition your downed teammate. It's strongly recommended to never carry your ally elsewhere, as you're left without any means of defending yourself, becoming a damage sponge, which on top of that can knock your ally out of your back, preventing your teammate from getting-up and wasting health and potentially leading to both your death and your teammate's death. The only scenario where you could carry your ally is if they died in the Poison Mist and there are no enemies around to attack you.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

<br>**Dropping**</br>
Immediately after picking up your downed teammate, you want to drop them as soon as possible. This allows you to get your teammate back up instantly and allow you to keep fighting right away, however it's still really risky, as the time it takes you to pick up and ally and drop them is enough for any good player to take away half your health. The only context where you should use it in a fight is when you or your other teammate manage to create a window in which you can safely pick and drop your downed teammate, such as when you knock down the enemy with 2 alphas or, in open fights, after knocking everyone away with beta. The Special Action's whole gauge has a 1 second reload time, so in practice it has no cooldown.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 4-string combo chain with low range and somewhat slow endlag. This should be a last resort option, since Full Bullet excels at short range but not quite point blank, so if an enemy gets close enough to get hit by melee then it's likely you or/and your enemy made a mistake, since at peak levels of Full Bullet this will never come into play.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This move is usually fairly bad on Full Bullet but it has a few key advantages. Firstly, it's fast, very fast, and because of this, you can often use it to commbo-break against grapple characters like Aizawa and Tamaki that can get a bit greedy with their combos. Secondly, it has very little endlag. Unlike its ground counterpart where no matter when you stop you will be left vulnerable to punishing, his air melee doesn't have this issue, and instantly cancels all endlag upon touching the ground, so it ends up being better than the ground variation.

</p>

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
Ideal for individuals with good aim, a path that makes the best use out of your alpha from the very beginning, recommended path for anyone not interested in beta-cancelling. Just stay in the backline and shoot alphas.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/a9b4y4b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### All-Rounder Path
This path gives access to beta cancels immediately, which opens up the combo game almost entirely and gives significantly increased survivability in the melee game due to beta cancels massively reducing beta endlag.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/b4a9y4b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### Melee Path
An alternative for those uninterested in aiming. However, this path is the worst of the three, as alpha levels contribute significantly to Full Bullet's raw damage, so it's hard to ignore them for so long.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/b4y4a9b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### Why is Gamma Lvl.4 recommended before Beta Lvl.9?
A third beta is nice, but often redundant as 2 allow you to do most things well, meanwhile, the size increase at Gamma Lvl.4 is very good at blocking doorways and making raw gamma viable.

### What about Gamma Lvl.9?
At Lvl.9, Gamma doesn't change most interactions even though it gets bigger, that's why it's recommended to instead lend the level cards to trusted teammates instead if you're at Alpha Lvl.9, Beta Lvl.4-9 and Gamma Lvl.4, especially if they're falling behind level-wise.

## Techs
### Hop Gamma
An optimization you can do is to perform a short hop + Gamma, as the grouned Gamma animation is actually slower than the jump startup animation and air Gamma animation combined. It's a minor optimization, but it has more uses in combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta Canceling
This way of using beta and gamma is extremely potent. This tech is performed by using beta right after having used another beta. By default, this skill has noticeable endlag, however beta can be used again before the
endlag is over. While starting the leap animation for the second beta, you can immediately cancel the whole animation for the second beta and perform a gamma instead. This is much faster than waiting for the endlag and perform a gamma after. The primary use of this tech is for combos, as many rely on Beta Canceling to work, however, it's also incredibly useful for Full Bullet's survival, as it reduces the punishing window for his beta, which usually leaves you defenseless for a second. With this not only you make yourself less vulnerable, but also allows you to position yourself better and follow up with alphas or another beta if the later is level 9.
This tech can only be used at Beta level 4 or above, as the canceling requires a second beta.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage. DMG displayed from all level 1 to all level 9.

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Beta (Heel)
A basic yet strong combo that's only really viable near a wall or low ceiling, as otherwise people can easily avoid the second beta by waking early. The combo only works on HP.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c0-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c0.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
A simple combo consisting of the first two melees, followed by a gamma that will push the enemy forward, and that you will be able to catch with a beta after jumping. This combo can be followed by a beta cancel, but it's outclassed by other combos. The 1-2 melee into gamma can miss on GP, but even though it's really hard to, the beta can technically land.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c1-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c1.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Dash Jump -> Gamma -> Alpha 
A fairly easy combo that works on both GP and HP and takes advantage of the Hop Gamma tech, but that has the downsides of trapping your opponents inside the gamma and expend both of your gamma charges, leaving you grounded. The combo leaves room for a second alpha, but due to the high downpower buildup, the damage will be minimal, so it's best to save that charge.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c2.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma
A combo that works on both HP and GP. It's a mildly demanding combo, requiring two beta charges and fast inputs to not miss the gamma. Additionally, the beta can send the enemy in directions that might make it difficult or impossible to land the gamma. It's recommended to aim the gamma to the left of where beta connected, as that's the direction where the beta will send the enemy. 
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c3.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (No Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma
A variation of the Beta into Beta Cancel into Gamma combo with lower damage that requires very specific positioning and doesn't work well up slopes, but follow ups are possible, especially with a wall. It can be used to catch people with i-frames, as they will often burn their i-frames to punish beta's endlag, letting the gamma connect.t
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c4.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma -> Gamma -> Alpha
An incredibly strong combo that can destroy the enemy's health. This combo is only really worth indoors, as using it outdoors will often miss due to the second gamma sending the opponent too far away.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c5-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c5.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
Another really strong combo that has the possibility of a follow up with alpha for an extra 24-40 DMG, but this follow up can be avoided by the enemy. For it to work, GP has to be broken with the second gamma or earlier. This combo can be made more consistent if the enemy is to your left or your right and by slightly angling the second gamma away from them. If your internet or server connection is bad, the first gamma should be followed by a dash jump into gamma instead of going to it, as this way you can save frames thanks to the Hop Gamma tech.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c6-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c6.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Dash Jump -> Gamma -> Beta
A variation of the Gamma into Gamma Hold into Beta combo. It gets outclassed by the previous version. Angling the second gamma makes it more consistent, and you can use alpha as a follow up, but the enemy can avoid it with an early wake.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c6.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
An extremely powerful combo that makes use of all 3 beta charges, for this reason, beta level 9 is mandatory to execute this combo. Performing this combo isn't very difficult if you're surroundings are open enough, and it can be made easier if you angle gamma to the sides. This combo has no follow up.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c8-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c8.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Ending Note
In any combo that ends with gamma you can choose to hold the gamma, which leads to a 50/50 where, if the opponent doesn't wake early you can land a free alpha, and if they do, you can come down with beta and catch the wake-up. Depending on the ammo you have leftover, full follow ups are possible here, as the wake resets downpower.

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
There will rarely be a situation where you can't shoot the Deku but he can, so even though Assault Deku has more range, your superior damage and melee game should let you win. Watch out for blackwhip combos if you go into the air with gamma or decide not to beta cancel the endlag on beta, as these are very open windows for Deku to shoot you.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet)
Tour choice of level path dramatically changes this match-up depending on their level path. A Full Bullet with alpha level.4 will usually beat a full bullet with beta level.4 unless you're fighting near very tight buildings. Aside from that, it's a mirror match, so whoever plays best will win.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Strike Bakugo is very simular to Assault Deku, except he trades the range for high burst from beta-alpha and beta-gamma combos. Keep in mind that due to Strike Bakugo's startup-laggy wake-up options, he's much more prone to being catched with beta on his wake-up than almost any other member in the cast. You should win in a ranged fight or close ranged fight, but if bakugo gets the jump with a beta-alpha combo you can find yourself struggling.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun)
Rapid Bakugo's alpha damage is high enough to challenge you quite well, but like regular Bakugo, he doesn't have good wake-up options. If you're feeling spicy you can catch his gamma before the explosion comes out with your beta heel, but this is risky and hard to do. If you can hit him out of the air then you'll do fine.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Rapid Ochaco is able to stack on large damage against you very easily if you use beta or gamma by catching your landing with her gamma. If you get hit by Ochaco's gamma you will lose the fight so be careful and keep yourself grounded and out of endlag so you can always roll it. If the Ochaco tries to spam cars at you in GP you can break the combo even in the air with alpha since she leaves small windows in between betas where you can land alphas, which will knock her down afterl anding the second.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites)
Assault Ochaco is full of endlag-heavy options with her alpha and beta. If you can get good at catching her beta while she's running with alphas you should win almost every time. Just be weary of gamma and try to stick to alphas against her, since her beta will interrupt your melee options very easily and effectively.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Iida outputs more damage from close distance and has armored options, so getting close is very risky. He's also able to break the wake-up catches with alpha or beta if he's smart. If your aim is unreasonably good then alphas is your best answer to Iida, but he's the hardest character to hit in the game with projectiles so good luck. Your best option is to try and catch him while he's burned out with alphas or by punishing the endlag of beta by rolling it and shooting an alpha. Trying melee options is often quite risky. Jump beta can beat out a reckless iida but be weary that if you dont hit him away with the beta then you'll lose half or more of your total HP/GP from an Iida combo.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Strike Shoto's range isn't the issue here, the issue is his gamma being able to greatly punish your beta, causing you to lose most of your health, and beta cancels dont help here since gamma doesn't block shotos gamma. Getting close is also a risky option since Strike Shoto's beta beats you out quite easily. To win use your vertical mobility to get high out of his beta and gammas range and shoot him with alphas. It will be tough but you can win this match-up with some strong aim and positioning.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame)
Going in the air can midagate everything Tech Shoto does, but if he's indoors it's better to not even try to fight him unless you already know he's super weak. When indoors against him simply keep yourself grounded and prepared to roll his beta's explosion. Combos won't often work against him since his alpha's ice will interrupt them most of the time.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Froppy has no way to beat you when you simply use alpha to catch her mobility or when you're too far away, and beta to punish her own betas. However, Froppy won't often face you in an even fight so be prepared to fight one off whenever you see one by keeping yourself as high health as the team fight allows to avoid a sneaky Froppy striking the moment you find yourself vulnerable.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
When kirishima gets close it can be quite hard to escape him without taking large amounts of damage, since your own wake-up options are quite bad. However, his alpha, beta and gamma all have openings to punish with alpha, so if he somehow gets close to you then knocking him down with 2 alphas is the best and only way to escape reliably.  Simply beat him by spamming alpha to make sure he never gets close and you'll win every time.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive)
Strike Kirishima is able to punish every option you have very heavily, with either his rock to punish being in the air from your gamma or using beta -> alpha -> gamma to punish your beta. That said his gamma does have a window to shoot him with alphas, but if the Kirishima has Hardening up he's usually trading 100 DMG taken for 250 dealt, so even this is bad to do consistently. If you're close enough your gamma goes through his beta shield, but if he's smart he will let go of beta when you get that close and punish you for trying. You can contribute in the fight against one by punishing his gamma and beta with your alpha, but if these are aimed at you then you're probably screwed.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Strike Denki is another beamer that you win against in the alpha trade department. Your beta is also fantastic at catching his wakeup since his mobility tool has a bad startup. Just be cautious that he doesn't punish you with a gamma, since if he does you will die, so if he doesn't burn his i-frames and get caught by the beta, then beta cancel in the direction of the Denki so that his gamma rights straight into your gamma assuming he doesn't get hit or if he does get hit then even better.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning)
This match-up is largely dependent on the situation. Your alpha is great at catching his slow gamma start-up and beta, but he's also great at punishing you with his own beta into alpha spam. You can catch his wake-up rather easily with your beta however. If he's super far away just try to stay near cover to break his line of sight.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
If momo gets close, it can be hard to escape her, but if you simply treat her like Assault Kirishima and never let her get close, you will win. That said her beta dash makes for a much better way to close the gap than Assault Kirishima does, and if she gets close she will be able to keep you still and prevent your escape with her alpha or gamma. Never fight one in doors and play cautiously against one.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch104/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
You lose if the monoma has good abilities but it's so hard to know what abilities he will have, hence, the match-up doesn't have a fixed difficulty. That said, just hit your alphas. Anything else is too risky to go for, given his kit and especially his gamma.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Just play and keep yourself away with gamma and alpha, she won't be able to touch you. She can catch you off guard and do large amounts of damage with her alpha and gamma though. If she's holding her beta out then just spam it with some high level alphas or get closer and use gamma to hit underneath the shield depending on range. Overall just stay far away and use height to your advantage.<br>
<br>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike)
She doesn't really have many windows outside of alpha to hit her, and if you do hit her she just charges her beta and erases you. If the player knows what they're doing, you will lose this match-up almost every time.<br>
<br>
