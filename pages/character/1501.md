This ability has a really good fire rate while spreading into a fan shape to cover a good amount of space. Due to that fan shape, it's also really good for kiting since you don't need to be as precise as if you were on a beamer character. This is your main damage tool when you aren't doing a combo, since you have 5 of them and they recharge really quickly. Do not mash all of them instantly unless you are just trying to instantly frag down a low target, if you wait just a slight bit between alphas, usually the time it takes to do dash jump alphas you effectively have infinite alphas at maximum level.

The alpha being thrown in an arc does allow it cover a deceptive amount of range away from you when a target is running, and you can see them in the distance about to land. If someone's jumping to avoid it you can follow the way they're moving to catch their landing with another alpha so they get hit. The biggest downside about this ability is that due to being a multi-hit it's inconsistent on its damage, but the high fire rate does allow it to make up for that a bit. 

When doing combos that include it you always want to try and land the debris itself for extra damage. His alpha also has very low downpower, making it really good for team combos when your teammate is staggering them especially with its fast fire rate. 

It is also decent to use it to hit airborne opponents when you don't have beta and they aren't in range to get hit by gamma, not the best thing but certainly better than nothing.

If alpha is maxed, it takes 4 direct alphas to finish a downed target.

## Beta Skill - Grudge Shoot

This is Assault Shigaraki's main "get off of me" tool, since it staggers and knocks down after you land two direct betas. If they're on the ground and you landed the debris itself, you can also ToD (Touch of Death) them with a combo to get them off, since they can't chase you anymore if they're dead. The decay area pulses 5 times after hitting the ground, wall or a ceiling. It is also important to lead your beta when trying to use it from a distance, if you aim at your opponent you will not hit them, most of time you want to predict where they're going to be able to land it.

Both the debris and pulses cause the "Decay" DoT (damage over time) effect. The decay from beta lasts for about 10 seconds, during that entire duration anything that would add to the combo meter will stay. For instance the high downpower added by a beta's debris will stay on the opponent for the whole time they have that decay effect damaging them. This is something to keep in mind if you do a combo on someone with only one beta or don't use two beta's debris, it's both a benefit and a detriment to him. On one hand you cannot use beta from a distance then alpha mash and later use beta's debris in a combo later without knocking them down if the decay is still active, on the other you don't need to immediately hit both beta to knock someone down when running from somebody else, you can use the first to stagger them during an armorless movement option then do the other later as they're using another movement option to force knockdown regardless of whether their move is armored or not. 

Beta pulses are actually pretty mid on their own, if someone knows the timing they can just dodge each pulse while sitting directly in it. Where the pulses are really good aside from during stun combos is when you know someone's sitting near a wall or are on a floor directly above you, since you can throw it to where they are and get tiny bits of damage, as well as apply decay and interrupt their healing animation, box opening or teammate pick up they might have been doing.

If your beta is at maximum level, one beta debris + one alpha debris will kill any downed target without the need to use extra skills, so if the enemy team does not have an instant resurrection character, you can just hit one alpha debris and throw a beta debris at a body to get rid of them.

The beta also initially spawns behind Shigaraki due to where his hand is during the animation, so this is important to keep in mind during combos where you're extremely close to the opponent and have already hit a beta debris, so that way you can avoid accidentally hitting them with the beta as it spawns. If you are close and already hit a beta debris, try to position your camera in a way where the beta won't spawn directly on them and won't hit them before it reaches the floor near them. 

## Gamma Skill - Catastrophe

Gamma (I will be calling the gamma dash "Gamma 1" and the gamma shockwave "Gamma 2"):  The decay from gamma functions exactly the same as betas, both gamma 1 and gamma 2 give the effect.  Gamma 1 adds 10 to the combo meter making it actually disgusting for his own combos as well as being a great extender for team combos. Gamma 2 adds 100 to the combo meter totaling to 110 if both parts land.


Both gamma 1 and 2's movement are momentum based, however this matters more for gamma 1. If you start a dash jump and gamma directly at the start you will go further than if you were standing still or just dashing. Using gamma 1 mid-air after using another or collapse hand will result in shig not going very far compared to dashing or dash jumping like i mentioned prior.

Gamma 2's hitbox is very egregious hitting about as high as space hop's maximum height, this makes it a very good anti-air tool and is currently one of his best ways to deal with fast airborne characters that can change their direction on the fly. It's also really good for hitting through walls if you know someone is sitting on the other side of it, similar to using beta's spread to hit through walls except this can toss someone around.

Gamma 2 is also great at catching a target's wakeup due to it having a large, linger high reaching hitbox, if they're on HP then you can get some good follow ups off of it.

A common misconception currently is that Gamma 1's distance increases with level up still. All that changes at levels 4 and 9 now is the cooldown rate 8 seconds for 1-3, 7 seconds for 4-8, 6 seconds for level 9 as well as the hitbox of Gamma 2 increasing in size. The travel distance has been unified across all levels for a while now. 
Special Action: This adds 200 to the combo meter while applying a defense debuff. This is a really good option for calling out wake ups since it has pretty similar tracking to melee 3. The defense debuff is extremely good for scaring someone into leaving you alone, making his combos even scarier or working with your team to just annihilate the debuffed target. Jump Special Action is a solid option for calling out someone who's going to jump and press an escape tool on wakeup as well if you know they'll go for that.
