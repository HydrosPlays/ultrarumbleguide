## Alpha Skill - Pillar Split

<p align="center">

</p>

Cementoss' Alpha is his main form of damage, mobility, cover and movement. With his Quirk Skill Alpha, Cementoss fires a cement ball that becomes a pillar on impact, with both the projectile and the pillar dealing damage. When firing at your feet, you will automatically ride it, which is esential for his structure building and overall gameplay. Leveling up increases the size, damage, count, and reload.

**Unaimed Version**</br>
This variation is niche and overall limited, having a short reach for a ranged skill in exchange for a wider spread, making it easier to land at the cost of landing less pellets, resulting in lower damage. The best use cases for it are finishing a downed person from close range or when kitting the opponent and you'd rather guarantee 3 pellets connecting rather than risking a miss entirely. If your aim is solid you will never need this version at all.

</p>

**Aimed Version**</br>
This is what you should do basically every time you use alpha, as this increases its range significantly, allowing it to reach twice as far as the unaimed version. Furthermore, the pellets don't get spread, which makes it easier to connect all 5 pellets for full damage. This variation has no downsides, so it's recommended to abuse it as much as possible.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101a2-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
It's recommended to increase your aimed-in sensitivity because of how often this skill is aimed in, since you'll need the ability to make larger adjustments to your aim faster than other characters that don't rely in aimed shots, due to how aiming in reduces the camera's speed.

A common technique you can use in extremely close range or against rapid character is to get around the slow camera speed is to switch off the aiming mode for camera control, and then switch on to shoot. If you're not comfortable with super high sensitivity, this technique might be helpful.
 
This skill is also very sensitive to damage modifiers due to how the game handles rounding damage, this means that even small buffs can lead to a substantial increase in damage compared to most other skills. However, this in turn means that enemies with defense buffs take noticeably less damage.

## Beta Skill - Manchester Smash 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101b.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

An AoE attack that gets stronger and larger when used from high heights. Hitting the enemy directly with the heel will make them take additional damage in the form of True Damage. The reload time of each charge is quite long, however the penalty reload time is pretty forgiving in comparison, so one shouldn't worry too much about conserving beta ammo.

**Grounded Beta**</br>
When used while touching the ground, this skill will be preceeded by a forward leap that helps you close distances. This ability has strong tracking when an enemy is close enough, which makes it great to catch wake-ups. One of the best setups for it is to use alpha twice to knock the enemy to the ground, and as the enemy gets up use beta to catch their wake. Regardless of what direction they get up, this skill will track onto them. It's a very good ability against mashers, and even has some workarounds against people who use their i-frames more wisely.

</p>

**Jump Beta**</br>
Used by using beta after jumping. This version of the skill is primarily used defensively as it's basically the grounded beta without tracking. This ability can be used to catch cocky Iidas trying to recklessly approach with alpha, however it's advised to stick to grounded beta for the tracking. You can use it to catch mashers who wake early by grabbing with the heel but this is niche at higher levels of Full Bullet play due to a certain tech.

</p>

**Height-Boosted Beta**</br>
This beta version is primarily used to get large amounts of spread damage in a fight when people don't know where you are. This is highly likely to go poorly if you don't sneak-attack the enemy group. Attempting this in a 1v1 situation without breaking line of sight first is a bad idea and will often result in you getting punished. It's recommended to save this for catching entire teams or group fights off-guard with massive AoE damage and poke with alphas whoever is still alive. This version of the beta is achieved by using the skill from a high position, setup by the stage or by his gamma skill.

## Gamma Skill - Ground Impact 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101y.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This skill is a valuable and versatile combo-enabling tool with mobility, defensive and offensive applications.</br>

<br>**Gamma as Mobility Tool**</br>
When holding gamma, you will create a stone ramp followed by a huge jump. The jump's strength is influenced by your camera's angle at the moment of jumping, for example, looking up will allow you to jump really high, while as if you look down instead, the jump will barely lift you off the ground. It's a very strong skill when it comes to vertical mobility, but it isn't great as horizontal mobility, which is why you shouldn't ever use gamma for horizontal movement. It's preferable to not use both charges to avoid the 10 seconds of penalty reload time and instead only use one and wait for it to come back, as the base reload time is 6 seconds long. If you must use 2 charges however, it's recommended that you use them in a short time span, such as using the first charge to jump on top of a building, and the second one to jump on top of an even higher building. This is so that you don't waste reload time, since if you use gamma followed by alpha spam/beta, and then you use gamma again, the time you spent reloading the charge you just used will be wasted, essentially turning an overall reload time of 11-12 seconds into 14-16 seconds.

    <small><em>High jump by looking up.</em></small>
</p>

**Gamma as Offensive Tool**</br>
This skill does solid damage, however it's hitbox is lackluster, since even though it's a close-range skill, it will not hit the enemy if there's isn't a small gap between you two, case where a jump beta would be better. Armored moves can very easily armor through it and hit you, so it's best to use it to counteract an Iida alpha or hit an Aizawa that slightly missed his air alpha, but overall, beta is still better at this. This skill does, however, have a lot of combo utility, so when it comes to the offense, you really want to use it as a combo tool rather than as a standalone attack.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101y3-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This ability can also damage the enemy through thinner walls, making it an option when you hear an enemy drinking or resurrecting a teammate near a wall. While this skill can also be used to trap characters in buildings and force them to take another exit and potentially lead them to Poison Mist DMG, most of the time it's better to save that gamma charge for either mobility or combos.

<br>**Gamma as Defensive Tool**</br>
This skill is very poor defensively as of the current update, since it doesn't block any AoE attacks in the game and its durability is quite lackluster. This skills defensive applications should be exclusively used as a way to block doorways, which can also be used aggressively to trap opponents indoors with you. Overall, you shouldn't expect this skill to protect you from anything.

    <small><em>Using gamma as a defensive wall.</em></small>
</p>
It is strongly advised to never use gamma from very high in the air. If your goal is to catch a wake-up, beta is a better option, and if one's out of betas, then alpha or air melee are better options, depending on your distance from the enemy. This ability's reload time isn't bad, but also not forgiving enough to spam it, and because it acts as your combo extender and mobility, you shouldn't waste it, as something else will always do a better job.

## Special Action - Carry to Safety
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/100s.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that allows you to save your downed teammates by carrying them and help them get up. It's a limited ability that can come handy from time to time.
After picking up a teammate, this skill has two parts: Carrying and Dropping.

<br>**Carrying**</br>
While carrying, you will be able to reposition your downed teammate. It's strongly recommended to never carry your ally elsewhere, since even though you gain a defense boost while carrying, you're left without any means of defending yourself, becoming a damage sponge, which on top of that can knock your ally out of your back, preventing your teammate from getting-up, wasting health and potentially leading to both your death and your teammate's death. The only scenario where you could carry your ally is if they died in the Poison Mist and there are no enemies around to attack you.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

<br>**Dropping**</br>
Immediately after picking up your downed teammate, you want to drop them as soon as possible. This allows you to get your teammate back up instantly and allow you to keep fighting right away, however it's still really risky, as the time it takes you to pick up and ally and drop them is enough for any good player to take away half your health. The only context where you should use it in a fight is when you or your other teammate manage to create a window in which you can safely pick and drop your downed teammate, such as when you knock down the enemy with 2 alphas or, in open fights, after knocking everyone away with beta. The action of dropping does not consume Special Action gauge, only the carrying does, so theoretically there's no limit to how many times you can use this ability.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 4-string combo chain with low range and somewhat slow endlag. This should be a last resort option, since Full Bullet excels at short range but not quite point blank, so if an enemy gets close enough to get hit by melee then it's likely you or/and your enemy made a mistake, since at peak levels of Full Bullet this will never come into play.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This move is usually fairly bad on Full Bullet but it has a few key advantages. Firstly, it's fast, very fast, and because of this, you can often use it to commbo-break against grapple characters like Aizawa and Tamaki that can get a bit greedy with their combos. Secondly, it has very little endlag. Unlike its ground counterpart where no matter when you stop you will be left vulnerable to punishing, his air melee doesn't have this issue, and instantly cancels all endlag upon touching the ground, so it ends up being better than the ground variation.
