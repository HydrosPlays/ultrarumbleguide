# [Cementoss](https://ultrarumble.com/character/101)

*Create sturdy platforms with cement! A fortress of protection keeps enemies at bay.*

Cementoss is one of My Hero Ultra Rumble's starter characters alongside [Izuku Midoriya](https://ultrarumble.com/character/01), [Ochaco Uraraka](https://ultrarumble.com/character/03), [Mt. Lady](https://ultrarumble.com/character/100), [Tomura Shigaraki](https://ultrarumble.com/character/15) and [Dabi](https://ultrarumble.com/character/17).
He is a unique Support character who can modify the battlefield; being a beast against any grounded characters but struggling when fighting high mobility and flying characters.

Pillar Split is his main form of damage, mobility, cover and movement. With Quirk Skill Alpha, Cementoss fires a cement ball that becomes a pillar on impact. Both the pillar and the initial cement ball projectile do damage.

Up to **3** Alpha pillars can exist at the same time; trying to create a 4th one makes the oldest pillar break. This pillars will last around 30 seconds and greatly expand in size the more the skill is leveled up, almost doubling its initial size.

### Alpha: Building

One of the Alpha's main uses consists of building structures; when firing at your feet you will automatically ride the pillar, esential for his overall gameplay. The pillar can be piled up on virtually any surface, including itself, Beta and Gamma. It's one of the best forms of vertical mobility in the game and can even nullify entire characters. Pillars can be stacked up to 3 times due to the natural limit, resulting in different scenarios like safe healing, pulling a downed ally from danger or creating quick cover in a fight.

</p>

** Creating Cover**

Cementoss can use both his **Beta Skill** and **Gamma Skill** on top of his pillars at any time, with both having their uses. 

- Beta can be used to create temporary cover and it's an excellent option to block line of sight against **Beamers** or characters with **high mobility**, however it will leave you uncovered from behind which other players can use to attack you. 

-Gamma creates a platform when used on top of a pillar and becomes an excellent way to block line of sight and expanding the surface area of your structure. It can be used to revive teammates from a high place that a lot of characters can't reach or shoot through and also healing. However it does come with some weaknesses, such as being very open to attacks from characters who can get above you and it does not block line of sight. Most opponents will know where to look for you on top of your pillar if you use a gamma on the top of it.

### Alpha: Blockage

Due to the Alpha pillar size, it's one of the best methods to block passages and entrances in My Hero Ultra Rumble. Since the pillar can be created in almost every surface blocking is very easy and rewarding to perform. Furthermore, Alpha pillars are resistant and will take many hits from the enemy to break. While this is often recomended, full teams or certain skills like charged [All For One's](https://ultrarumble.com/character/16) Alpha can break the pillar fast.

## Beta Skill - Load-Bearing Wall 
<p align="center">

</p>

When activated, this skill will create a cement wall in front of you at your aim's direction. The cement wall will only pop up once Cementoss is touching a surface, so activating in the air will make him fast fall until he lands on one. This Skill is the most damaging move of his kit.

### Molding

Beta can be molded by using various inputs as its being built (if no input is given the wall will default to a vertical wall):

**Basic**: holding the left or right input will create a horizontal wall, while holding forward will create a vertical wall. 

(gif)

**Mixed**: by inputting forward and then either left or right the wall will be created in a "T" shape. If you switch the order, the wall will become a "U" shape instead.

(gif)

**Exceptional**: if there is an object blocking the wall from going horizontally on one side, holding any side input will make it be created on the opposite direction.

## Gamma Skill - Structural Slab

</p>

Launches a blob of cement which forms a slab on impact. Both the projectile and slab deal damage, with the projectile flinching on hit. If used in the air, Cementoss will get launched in the opposite direction of where heâ€™s facing. Using gamma on jump wakeup towards the ground will launch you into the air, a great escape tool and a good mixup.

This skill is a great combo tool thanks to the blob's flinch effect, aswell as an alternative mobility tool. Gamma is also often used as a damage tool and as a structure element (finishing off Alpha towers). While it can be used to block passages, it isn't as practical as Alpha or Beta.

## Special Action - Defensive Wall

</p>
Revives a downed teammate, forming a concrete box around them. This skill can go through walls but has a limited range, only 1 charge and can't be activated in the air. It's a very powerful skill but can be tricky and situational to use.
Some noteworthy interactions:

- If the downed ally is falling at the same time you use Special Action on them, they will spawn under the concrete box.

- There is a bug that makes the concrete box spawn around yourself instead of your ally, although what causes it is currently unknown.
