Pillar Split is his main form of damage, mobility, cover and movement. With Quirk Skill Alpha, Cementoss fires a cement ball that becomes a pillar on impact. Both the pillar and the initial cement ball projectile do damage.

</p>

Up to **3** Alpha pillars can exist at the same time; trying to create a 4th one makes the oldest pillar break.

When firing at your feet you will automatically ride the pillar, esential for his structure building and overall gameplay.

### Alpha: Building

One of the Alpha's main uses consists of building structures. It can be piled up on virtually any surface, including itself, Beta and Gamma. This fact, mixed with the ammount of charges and its size-shape make it the perfect building block for any sort of structures. The most common one consists of piling 3 alphas on top of eachother (often finishing the top with a Gamma), often used to heal from a high and safe place.

### Alpha: Blockage

Due to the Alpha pillar size, it's one of the best methods to block passages and entrances in My Hero Ultra Rumble. Since the pillar can be created in almost every surface blocking is very easy and rewarding to perform. Furthermore, Alpha pillars are resistant and will take many hits from the enemy to break. While this is often recomended, full teams or certain skills like charged [All For One's](https://ultrarumble.com/character/16) Alpha can break the pillar fast.

## Beta Skill - Load-Bearing Wall 
<p align="center">

</p>

When activated, this skill will create a cement wall in front of you at your aim's direction. The cement wall will only pop up once Cementoss is touching a surface, so activating in the air will make him fast fall until he touches one. This Skill is the most damaging move of his kit. Leveling up increases its size, damage, reload, and count. At level 9 its massive.

### Molding

Beta can be molded by using various inputs as its being built (if no input is given the wall will default to a vertical wall):

**Basic**: holding the left or right input will create a horizontal wall, while holding forward will create a vertical wall. 

(gif)

**Mixed**: by inputting forward and then either left or right the wall will be created in a "T" shape. If you switch the order, the wall will become a "U" shape instead.

(gif)

**Exceptional**: if there is an object blocking the wall from going horizontally on one side, inputting any side direction will make it go purely in the opposite direction, example being, if you are in a room with a wall on you left, holding the right input will make it go fully right instead of creating the regular "T" shape.

## Gamma Skill - Structural Slab

Launches a blob of cement which forms a slab on impact. Both the projectile and slab deal damage, with the projectile flinching on hit. If used in the air, Cementoss will get launched in the opposite direction of where heâ€™s facing. Using gamma on jump wakeup towards the ground will launch you into the air, a great escape tool and a good mixup.
This skill is a great combo tool thanks to the blob's flinch effect, aswell as an alternative mobility tool.

Gamma is often used as a damage tool and as a structure element (finishing off Alpha towers). While it can be used to block passages, it isn't as practical as Alpha or Beta.
