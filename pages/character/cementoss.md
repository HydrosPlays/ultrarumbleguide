## Alpha Skill - Pillar Split

Cementoss' Alpha is his main form of damage, mobility, cover and movement. With his Quirk Skill Alpha, Cementoss fires a cement ball that becomes a pillar on impact. Up to **3** Alpha pillars can exist at the same time; trying to create a 4th one makes the oldest pillar break. Both the pillar and the initial cement ball projectile do damage.

</p>

When firing at your feet you will automatically ride the pillar, esential for his structure building and overall gameplay. 

(insert gifs - making one pillar and making 4 then breaking)

### Alpha: Building

One of the Alpha's main uses consists of building structures. It can be piled up on virtually any surface, including itself, Beta and Gamma. This fact, mixed with the ammount of charges and its size-shape make it the perfect building block for any sort of structures. The most common one consists of piling 3 alphas on top of eachother (often finishing the top with a Gamma), often used to heal from a high and safe place.

### Alpha: Blockage

Due to the Alpha pillar size, it's one of the best methods to block passages and entrances in My Hero Ultra Rumble. Since the pillar can be created in almost every surface blocking is very easy and rewarding to perform. Furthermore, Alpha pillars are resistant and will take many hits from the enemy to break. While this is often recomended, full teams or certain skills like charged [All For One's](https://ultrarumble.com/character/16) Alpha can break the pillar fast.

## Beta Skill - Load-Bearing Wall 
<p align="center">

</p>

When activated, this skill will create a cement wall in front of you at your aim's direction. The cement wall will only pop up once Cementoss is touching a surface, so activating in the air will make him fast fall until he touches one. This Skill is the most damaging move of his kit. Leveling up increases its size, damage, reload, and count. At level 9 its massive.

### Molding

Beta can be molded by using various inputs as its being built (if no input is given the wall will default to a vertical wall):

**Basic**: holding the left or right input will create a horizontal wall, while holding forward will create a vertical wall. 

(gif)

**Mixed**: by inputting forward and then either left or right the wall will be created in a "T" shape. If you switch the order, the wall will become a "U" shape instead.

(gif)

**Exceptional**: if there is an object blocking the wall from going horizontally on one side, inputting any side direction will make it go purely in the opposite direction, example being, if you are in a room with a wall on you left, holding the right input will make it go fully right instead of creating the regular "T" shape.

## Gamma Skill - thing

Launches a blob of cement which forms a slab on impact. Both the projectile and slab deal damage, with the projectile flinching on hit. If used in the air, Cementoss will get launched in the opposite direction of where heâ€™s facing. Using gamma on jump wakeup towards the ground will launch you into the air, a great escape tool and a good mixup.
This skill is a great combo tool thanks to the blob's flinch effect, aswell as an alternative mobility tool.

Gamma is often used as a damage tool and as a structure element (finishing off Alpha towers). While it can be used to block passages, it isn't as practical as Alpha or Beta.

## Special Action - Carry to Safety
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/100s.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that allows you to save your downed teammates by carrying them and help them get up. It's a limited ability that can come handy from time to time.
After picking up a teammate, this skill has two parts: Carrying and Dropping.

<br>**Carrying**</br>
While carrying, you will be able to reposition your downed teammate. It's strongly recommended to never carry your ally elsewhere, since even though you gain a defense boost while carrying, you're left without any means of defending yourself, becoming a damage sponge, which on top of that can knock your ally out of your back, preventing your teammate from getting-up, wasting health and potentially leading to both your death and your teammate's death. The only scenario where you could carry your ally is if they died in the Poison Mist and there are no enemies around to attack you.

</p>

<br>**Dropping**</br>
Immediately after picking up your downed teammate, you want to drop them as soon as possible. This allows you to get your teammate back up instantly and allow you to keep fighting right away, however it's still really risky, as the time it takes you to pick up and ally and drop them is enough for any good player to take away half your health. The only context where you should use it in a fight is when you or your other teammate manage to create a window in which you can safely pick and drop your downed teammate, such as when you knock down the enemy with 2 alphas or, in open fights, after knocking everyone away with beta. The action of dropping does not consume Special Action gauge, only the carrying does, so theoretically there's no limit to how many times you can use this ability.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 4-string combo chain with low range and somewhat slow endlag. This should be a last resort option, since Full Bullet excels at short range but not quite point blank, so if an enemy gets close enough to get hit by melee then it's likely you or/and your enemy made a mistake, since at peak levels of Full Bullet this will never come into play.

</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This move is usually fairly bad on Full Bullet but it has a few key advantages. Firstly, it's fast, very fast, and because of this, you can often use it to commbo-break against grapple characters like Aizawa and Tamaki that can get a bit greedy with their combos. Secondly, it has very little endlag. Unlike its ground counterpart where no matter when you stop you will be left vulnerable to punishing, his air melee doesn't have this issue, and instantly cancels all endlag upon touching the ground, so it ends up being better than the ground variation.
