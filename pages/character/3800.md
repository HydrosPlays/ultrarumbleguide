Mr. Compress’ Alpha is his best move by far and his most reliable source of damage. It consists of 3 main components: the initial marble he throws, the object that comes out  and the shockwave once it lands.

### The Marble
The marble has a few unique properties. For starters, no matter the level of your Alpha a direct hit with the marble will always deal 5 damage, a fairly insignificant amount but it starts to pile up once it gets combined with the other parts of the Alpha. On top of this extra damage, hitting an opponent who has GP will cause them to be stunned in place, allowing you to follow up with more alphas as the opponent won't be able to move. This aspect of his Alpha, alongside its really low Knockdown Value (which I’ll touch on soon) turns Compress is a GP destroying machine, very hard to counteract once you’re stunned. 

The marble also travels in a different way from any other projectile currently in the game; after throwing the marble, instead of going straight forward like a generic projectile, it will actually travel on an arc. On top of that, if the marble hits a wall or the floor it will bounces off instead of dissapearing. It's very much worth noting however that both of these properties change when you enter Aim Mode: the arc/angle at which Compress throws the marble is much different, allowinging it to travel farther distances and slowing the spawning of the object inside the marble. Most importantly, because of both of these variations in Aim Mode bouncing the marble off of objects or a wall to hit enemies is much easier.

### The Object

These items include the barrel at levels 1-3, the boulder at 4-6, and the truck at 7-9, each being bigger than the previous (Trucks are especially excellent at hitting enemies standing to close to the edge of a corner, like doorways for example, thanks to this expanded size and hitbox). This part of the Alpha is the move that deals most of the damage when playing Compress, and a large part of that comes from this moves incredibly low KV (knockdown value). Similar to the Marble, the Object's KD Value is so low that outside of rare circumstances and niche situations, you should really never have to worry about knocking people down, and such can just continue to blast them with trucks. It is recomended to always keep a spare charge in your pocket however, as the penalty reload time after spending all of them is much longer than the individual ones.

### The Shockwave

The shockwave from Compress’ alpha comes out from wherever the released object hits the ground, with its size and damage being dictated by level just like with the object itself. There’s really nothing special about the shockwave, aside from the fact it expands the range at which you can hit enemies not currently in your line of sight.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand

Compress’ Beta Skill is a barrier that can stop projectiles from hurting him or allies.
When a projectile hits this barrier, Compress will quickly Compress it and reflect it back, dealing some extra damage the original projectile didn't have. 

Different Moves can have 3 types of interactions with Compress' Beta: reflect, block and ignore.

**Reflectable Moves**

These moves get sent back with extra damage if they interact with Compress' Beta: Delaware Smash Air Force, Delaware Smash Full Bullet!, AP Shot, Improvised Grenades, AP Machine Gun, Home Run Comet (thrown), Comet Bunt (uncharged), Blazing Fields of Roaring Fire, Scorching Flame Wave, Ice Fang Wind Flame, Red Strike, Create: Strike and Stop, Create: Bullet Rain (cannonball only), Electro-target, Electro-Trident, Big Fist (Copy), Stone-throwing Fist, Gale Burst, Spiraling Wave, Spiraling Surf, Texas Smash, Texas Smash Gatling, Carolina Smash (uncharged), P Mic α, Cement α (before hitting ground) γ (before hitting ground), Endi β, QSS Endi α γ, Hawks α γ, Mt. Lady α (giant and reg), QSS Shig α (before hitting ground) β, AFO α (charged and uncharged), Dabi α, QSS Dabi α, Toga α, QSS Toga α, Twice α, Compress α, Overhaul α, Kuro α.

**Blockable Moves**

These moves will get blocked, avoiding damage but not reflecting a projectile back: Deku γ, QSS Todo γ, Ocha α, Tsu α, Momo melee 3 (thrown hammer), QSS Denki β, Nejire β, Amajiki α (ADS and unADS) γ, Shinso α SA, Aizawa α, P Mic β (charged and uncharged), Endi α, Toga γ, QSS Toga γ, Twice γ, Kuro β.

If a move is not featured on either of these two lists, Compress’ beta cannot interact with it in any way. 
These lists will be updated as more characters and QSS release.


Beta is Compress’ most defensive tool, able to block all sorts of damage as you can see above. This has a variety of uses, the most obvious of which is to use it mid shoot off to reflect alphas at trigger happy opponents. Swapping back and forth between this and your alpha conserves your own health and can often force enemies into engaging with you close up so you can start Melee combos. This move is percentage based, meaning you can hold it up as much as you want, but the more hits it absorves the more percentage gets consumed until it's forced into reload. A helpful tip is that this move can be rolled to avoid the EndLag of deactivating it.
 However this isn't the only way to use your Beta; other uses consist in leaning into Compress’ Support role by protecting. teammates from taking damage too. Stand in front of allies opening boxes, supply drops or even finishing enemies to stop your opponents from interrupting your team. Even standing in front of an ally while they have a shoot off, essentially making them invincible while the fight is happening. Beta is widely considered one of the worst moves in the game, so show everyone just how useful (or annoying) it can actually be.
