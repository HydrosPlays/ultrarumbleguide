Mr. Compress’ Alpha is his best move by far and his most reliable source of damage. It consists of 3 main components: the initial marble he throws, the object that comes out  and the shockwave once it lands.

### The Marble
The marble has a few unique properties. For starters, no matter the level of your Alpha a direct hit with the marble will always deal 5 damage, a fairly insignificant amount but it starts to pile up once it gets combined with the other parts of the Alpha. On top of this extra damage, hitting an opponent who has GP will cause them to be stunned in place, allowing you to follow up with more alphas as the opponent won't be able to move. This aspect of his Alpha, alongside its really low Knockdown Value (which I’ll touch on soon) turns Compress is a GP destroying machine, very hard to counteract once you’re stunned. 

The marble also travels in a different way from any other projectile currently in the game; after throwing the marble, instead of going straight forward like a generic projectile, it will actually travel on an arc. On top of that, if the marble hits a wall or the floor it will bounces off instead of dissapearing. It's very much worth noting however that both of these properties change when you enter the ADS (zoom in) state. For starters the arc/angle at which Compress throws the marble is much different, allowinging it to travel farther distances. The object inside also takes much longer to actually explode out of the marble as well. But most importantly, because of both of these changes bouncing the marble off of objects or a wall to hit enemies is much easier. For my example I’ll use the bottom floor of the UA building. Say you're chasing somebody and they decide to run up the stairs, breaking line of sight as they turn the corner. Well instead of struggling to hit directs before you lose this person, you can ADS, and then try to bank marbles off the wall so they bounce past the corner instead, ideally hitting your fleeing foe. This tech doesn’t just work here, but it's a fairly popular location where I have to use it, so if you want to practice it I’d suggest engaging in fights around this area. Now lets finally move to the rest of the Alpha.The next part to discuss is the object that explodes out of Mr. Compress’ Alpha. These items include the barrel at levels 1-3, the boulder at 4-6, and the truck at 7-9. This is where most of the damage is coming from when you use Compress, and a large part of that comes from this moves incredibly low KV (knockdown value). For those who don't know, every character has their own KV which determines when they will be knocked over with i-frames. The vast majority of moves in the game when damaging an opponent will start adding up to this KV, and when it's hit or exceeded, the opponent will be knocked down. The KV on Compress’ alpha is so low however that outside of rare circumstances and niche situations, you should really never have to worry about knocking people down, and as such can just continue to blast them with trucks. Do try to always keep one in your pocket however, as the penalty reload is much longer than the individual charges returning.The only other thing to really note about this part is the varying sizes of the released objects. Obviously it's easier to hit the bigger the released object is, but it's worth mentioning that just like with the arc of the marble, the size of the object can also help contribute to hitting enemies you can’t see. Trucks are especially excellent at hitting enemies standing to close to the edge of a corner, like doorways for example. Now onto the shockwave.The shockwave from Compress’ alpha comes out from wherever the released object hits the ground, with its size and damage being dictated by level just like with the object itself. There’s really nothing special about the shockwave, aside from the fact it expands the range at which you can hit enemies not currently in your line of sight. Nothing else to really say about it.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand

Next we’ll move onto the Beta, which doesn’t have nearly as much to talk about so don’t worry. Compress’ beta is a shield he sticks out in front of him in order to stop projectiles from hurting him or allies. Moves can have 3 different types of interactions with Compress’ beta, and those are moves he reflects, as in shoots them back at opponents and dealing them damage. Moves it blocks, meaning it still stops them but won’t send them back to damage his opponent. Finally there are moves that don't get stopped at all, primarily melee moves but some others as well.

α = alpha β = beta γ = gamma SA = special action QQS = Quirk skillset

 Here is a list for all moves it reflects: Deku α, QSS Deku α, Baku α β, QSS Baku α, Ocha β (thrown), QSS Ocha α (uncharged), Todo α SA, QSS Todo α, QSS Kiri γ, Momo α γ (cannonball only), Denki α, QSS Denki α, Monoma α, Kendo α, QSS Kendo α, Nejire α γ, All Might α, QSS All Might α β(uncharged), P Mic α, Cement α (before hitting ground) γ (before hitting ground), Endi β, QSS Endi α γ, Hawks α γ, Mt. Lady α (giant and reg), QSS Shig α (before hitting ground) β, AFO α (charged and uncharged), Dabi α, QSS Dabi α, Toga α, QSS Toga α, Twice α, Compress α, Overhaul α, Kuro α.

Here is a list of every move it blocks: Deku γ, QSS Todo γ, Ocha α, Tsu α, Momo melee 3 (thrown hammer), QSS Denki β, Nejire β, Amajiki α (ADS and unADS) γ, Shinso α SA, Aizawa α, P Mic β (charged and uncharged), Endi α, Toga γ, QSS Toga γ, Twice γ, Kuro β.

If a move is not featured on either of these two lists, Compress’ beta cannot interact with it in any way. These lists will be updated as more characters and QSS release.

Beta is Compress’ most defensive tool, able to block all sorts of damage as you can see above. This has a variety of uses, the most obvious of which is to use it mid shoot off to reflect alphas at trigger happy opponents. Swapping back and forth between this and your alpha conserves your own health and can often force enemies into engaging with you close up so you can start melee combos. Remember you can roll out of beta, meaning you can dodge a move used to close distance on you and then continue the fight, or reposition with your gamma. However this isn't the only way to use your beta; consider leaning into Compress’ support role by blocking teammates from taking damage too. Stand in front of allies opening boxes, supply drops or even finishing enemies to stop your opponents from interrupting your team. Even standing in front of an ally while they have a shoot off instead, essentially making them invincible while the fight is happening. Beta is widely considered one of the worst moves in the game, so show everyone just how useful (or annoying) it can actually be.
