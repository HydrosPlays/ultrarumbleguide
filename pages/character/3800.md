Mr. Compress’ Alpha is his best move by far and his most reliable source of damage. It consists of 3 main components: the initial marble he throws, the object that comes out, and the shockwave once that item lands. All 3 of these components are important to Compress’ gameplay, so I’ll be discussing each part individually to hopefully make this as easy as possible to understand.
The marble itself is what Compress actually throws, and it has quite a few unique properties. For starters, no matter the level of your Alpha a direct hit with the marble will always deal 5 damage (without TUNING). A fairly insignificant amount of damage, but an amount that's always appreciated regardless. On top of this extra damage on a direct hit, hitting an opponent who has GP directly will cause them to be stunned in place, easily allowing you to follow up with more alphas as the opponent can’t move. This aspect of his Alpha, alongside its astronomically low knockdown value (which I’ll touch on soon) means Compress is a GP destroying machine, and very hard to counteract once you’re stunned. In addition to the previous two points, the marble also travels in a way different from any other projectile currently in the game. After throwing the marble, instead of going straight forward like many other projectiles, Compress’ travels on an arc. On top of that if the marble hits a wall or the floor, you may notice it bounces off before it releases its item. These two properties actually allow compress to hit opponents he can’t even see, as by using the arc of the marble, you can make it so enemies on a space above you get hit by the object that was released by your marble on its way to the ground. The bounce on the other hand allows you to bank shots off of objects to hit fleeing enemies or ones chasing you around corners.It's very much worth noting however that both of these properties change when you enter the ADS (zoom in) state. For starters the arc/angle at which Compress throws the marble is much different, allowinging it to travel farther distances. The object inside also takes much longer to actually explode out of the marble as well. But most importantly, because of both of these changes bouncing the marble off of objects or a wall to hit enemies is much easier. For my example I’ll use the bottom floor of the UA building. Say you're chasing somebody and they decide to run up the stairs, breaking line of sight as they turn the corner. Well instead of struggling to hit directs before you lose this person, you can ADS, and then try to bank marbles off the wall so they bounce past the corner instead, ideally hitting your fleeing foe. This tech doesn’t just work here, but it's a fairly popular location where I have to use it, so if you want to practice it I’d suggest engaging in fights around this area. Now lets finally move to the rest of the Alpha.The next part to discuss is the object that explodes out of Mr. Compress’ Alpha. These items include the barrel at levels 1-3, the boulder at 4-6, and the truck at 7-9. This is where most of the damage is coming from when you use Compress, and a large part of that comes from this moves incredibly low KV (knockdown value). For those who don't know, every character has their own KV which determines when they will be knocked over with i-frames. The vast majority of moves in the game when damaging an opponent will start adding up to this KV, and when it's hit or exceeded, the opponent will be knocked down. The KV on Compress’ alpha is so low however that outside of rare circumstances and niche situations, you should really never have to worry about knocking people down, and as such can just continue to blast them with trucks. Do try to always keep one in your pocket however, as the penalty reload is much longer than the individual charges returning.The only other thing to really note about this part is the varying sizes of the released objects. Obviously it's easier to hit the bigger the released object is, but it's worth mentioning that just like with the arc of the marble, the size of the object can also help contribute to hitting enemies you can’t see. Trucks are especially excellent at hitting enemies standing to close to the edge of a corner, like doorways for example. Now onto the shockwave.The shockwave from Compress’ alpha comes out from wherever the released object hits the ground, with its size and damage being dictated by level just like with the object itself. There’s really nothing special about the shockwave, aside from the fact it expands the range at which you can hit enemies not currently in your line of sight. Nothing else to really say about it.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand
<p align="center">

</p>

When activated, this skill will create a cement wall in front of you at your aim's direction. The cement wall will only pop up once Cementoss is touching a surface, so activating in the air will make him fast fall until he lands on one. This Skill is the most damaging move of his kit.

### Molding

Beta can be molded by using various inputs as its being built (if no input is given the wall will default to a vertical wall):

**Basic**: holding the left or right input will create a horizontal wall, while holding forward will create a vertical wall. 

**Mixed**: by inputting forward and then either left or right the wall will be created in a "T" shape. If you switch the order, the wall will become a "U" shape instead.

**Exceptional**: if there is an object blocking the wall from going horizontally on one side, holding any side input will make it be created on the opposite direction.

## Gamma Skill - Magician's Choice

Launches a blob of cement which forms a slab on impact. Both the projectile and slab deal damage, with the projectile flinching on hit. This skill is a great combo tool thanks to the flinch effect, aswell as an alternative mobility tool: if used in the air, Cementoss will get launched in the opposite direction of where he’s facing. This technique can be improved further by performing it on jumping wakeup towards the ground, which will launch you into the air, leading to escaping or combos.

</p>

Gamma is also often used as a structure element (finishing off Alpha towers as we saw previously) and damage tool. 
While it can be used to block passages, it isn't recommended since it isn't as practical as Alpha or Beta blocking.

## Special Action - Magic Resurrection
<p align="center">

</p>
Revives a downed teammate, forming a concrete box around them. This skill can go through walls but has a limited range, only 1 charge and can't be activated in the air. It's a very powerful skill but can be tricky and situational to use.
Some noteworthy interactions:

- If the downed ally is falling at the same time you use Special Action on them, they will spawn under the concrete box.

- There is a bug that makes the concrete box spawn around yourself instead of your ally, although what causes it is currently unknown with some believing it might be caused by lag and/or pressing the Special Action button at the same time as you land.


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3 hit combo in which Cementoss does 2 slaps for 20 damage followed by a series of repeated strikes, hitting for around 110 to 120 in total. While it is a decent combo tool, Ground Melee is hard to reliably use due to Cementoss' knockback and how short range it is. Where Cementoss' Melee shines is in breaking his own structures: Cementoss' Pillars have a unique property that is shared among other characters who can generate structures aswell, being that he can break his own structures very quickly meanwhile both allies and enemies require a big amount of hits. Ground melee requires all 3 hits of the move to break a structure at all levels. 

**Air Melee**<br>
Air melee consists on an uppercut which hits for 65 damage. Air melee is easier to use than his regular Melee due to the versatile nature of air melees, but also due to the fact that you can use this move while dropping from Pillars. Similar to his Grounded Melee, Cementoss can break his own structures with this move, taking only 1 hit for all structures under Level 9 and 2 for this last one.

## Leveling Paths

**The Basic:** this is the most common Levelling Path for Cementoss. It consists on levelling up Alpha to Level 9, followed up by  levelling up Gamma to this same level, leaving Beta for last. This route is based on mobility and will give Cementoss various movement options aswell as a lot of ranged attacks, at the price of not having a reliable big damaging move.

</p>

**The Striker**: this is the least common Cementoss levelling path and it consists on levelling up Alpha all the way up to 9, and then level up Beta to 9, levelling up Gamma last. With this method Cementoss will have his primary tool at maximum power, size and charges, aswell as a very powerful and damaging attack, at the cost of less mobility and building options.

</p>

**The Belligerent**: this path is often used when Cementoss are forced to fight in earlier game. Since Cementoss is a level dependant character (weak early game, really strong late game), this is the most optimal route if you want to have a chance at fighting. This path will make his Alpha and Beta reach the sweet spot between Weak and Really Strong (Level 4) leaving him with decent movement and attack options. After reaching those sweet spots you can keep levelling up following **The Striker** path.

**Something to note**

All of these levelling paths have something in common: they always level up the Alpha Skill first. Reason being that this move is Cementoss' most important one. It's his movement, attack, cover, structure move,... While you technically *can* play without using Alpha, it's the move that makes Cementoss Cementoss. We STRONGLY recommend to always prioritize this move.

## Techs

**Walk Cancelling**



**Alpha Shelfing**

"Shelfing" consists in placing an Alpha Pillar infront of you on a Pillar Tower without riding it, giving the illusion of being on top of it while you are actually hiding behind it. This is most often used for healing and can be done just by throwing an Alpha Pillar at the corner of the previous one you are standing on and then walking off onto the "shelf". Most enemies won't know to look for a Cementoss healing on a Shelfed Pillar however you are still very visible from behind. Shelfed pillars can also be used in tandem with beta in order to hit the ground from max pillar height. Beta travels down shelfs when at level 9 and can be used on people trying to climb up or people at the base of your pillar.

**Alpha Pushing**



**Beta Elevator**

Beta elevator is a tech that can be used in order to gain height mid fight, an alternative to pillaring. It can be done just by looking up and using your beta. This is best done at level 9 (thanks to the size). Enemies often don’t expect this Tech due to how fast it is and the fact that you can hit them with the Beta at the same time as this is done.

Unfortunately this Tech cannot be done on the Nintendo Switch version due to framerate limitations.

**Wall Techs**

Both Gamma and Alpha are useful for hitting opponents through walls, however gamma is the most reliable for this by far. Placing gamma anywhere near a wall without letting the projectile itself hit it will create the slab indoors, ignoring all objects. This can be useful for stopping healing, reviving, or can simply be used if you trap an opponent indoors and the room is small enough. With the size increasing at level 4 and 9, it is easier and more effective to hit opponents the higher the level of your Gamma. Alpha can also be used for hitting indoors however it can only hit if the opponent is directly against it due to how much smaller the alpha hitbox is compared to Gamma's.
Beta can also be used to hit through walls, yet it won’t actually create the beta on the other side and only the initial section will deal damage before disappearing on spawn.  Additionally, this only works on thin walls like glass or temporary structures, and only works if both you and the opponent are directly against the wall.
