*The charisma of evil that steals Quirks from others. Use the various Quirks to lay waste to your enemies!*

Izuku Midoriya - Full bullet is an all-rounder character that excels at catching wake-ups. He differs from the average all-rounder by providing different utility in the form of inturuption with his alpha knockdown and beta grab. His burst damage is notably high at all ranges but he lacks armor and often struggles with mobility and survivability.

## Alpha Skill - Final Blow 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch016_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

All For One releases a violent blast of air from his palm that damages opponents in his path, a simple yet effective attack that can be compared to that of most Beamer characters like [Izuku Midoriya](https://ultrarumble.com/character/1), [Shoto Todoroki](https://ultrarumble.com/character/4), etc.

By tapping the move you will release a blast of air that will knock down the opponent after they are struck 4 times, dealing solid damage in the process, but holding this Alpha for around 1.5s will make it get charged and release a much larger and powerful attack, with the downside of it being slower and taking up 2 charges instead of 1. This Charged Alpha has a unique property that makes it really useful, that being the ability to destroy any breakable structure with just one blow; Civillian Houses, Buildings, [Cementoss](https://ultrarumble.com/character/101) Structures and even things like Itsuka Kendo's Shield can be destroyed with just one Charged Alpha.



One thing to note is that you should not use Charged Alpha on someone who is far away unless you’re trying to sneak attack them and deal large amounts of damage in the process. Also when attempting to catch someone’s wake-up it is unwise to charge your Alpha, seeing as it has greater EndLag and a smaller hitbox than your Beta, which is extremely good at catching wakeups

## Beta Skill - Manipulative Claw
<p align="center">

</p>

All For One extends his right fingers forward, catching any opponents in front of him in a cascade of chip damage. By tapping this move All For One will hit any opponent in front of him with up to 3 ticks of damage, and by holding this move All For One can hit an opponent with a maximum of 6 ticks before they are knocked to the ground. You usually want to hold this move to 5 ticks and then use an alpha for solid damage, and so you don’t stay in the air too long. All For One is at his weakest in the air, so holding beta midair until you knock everyone down is not a wise decision. 
This move could be considered one of the top 10 most useful moves in the entire game, since it can start combos, continue combos, end combos, catch wakeups extremely easily at mid-high levels and many other games. Adding to this, All For One's Beta also has the capability of going through walls, adding a lot more potential to this. Practicing predicting where your opponent is going to go to score even more damage, and potentially some kills, is recommended.
Something to note is that this move starts off rather small and poor: it covers almost nothing, not being useful the majority of the time unless you can get a guaranteed hit, like blocking a doorway. The risk of going for it is too heavy, and it's better to just alpha spam or disengage if you have a level one Beta. But the move becomes a massive and damaging AoE (Area of Effect) move at max level.

## Gamma Skill - Black Field
<p align="center">

</p>

All For One activates his warping quirk, pushing or pulling every enemy within its vicinity towards or away from you. 
By holding until the move is finished charging All For One will suck in every enemy inside of his Gamma’s AOE. After pulling in enemies All For One can do a multitude of things, such as using Alpha, Beta, Melee, Air Melee, use stolen quirks, ... You can also use this to Pull downed opponents to finsish them off safely and quickly. On paper this move is fantastic because it can start All For Ones's most powerful combos and handle crowd control, however in reality it can be a double edged sword: it is extremely easy to roll and it leaves you extremely vulnerable while you’re pulling and if you fail the move. Activating this Skill in the air can be more useful than just using it on the ground, the opponents will be pulled in the air making it so much harder for them to get out of combos or escape the Storm.

By tapping or holding this move and releasing it early All For One will push every enemy in his gamma’s range away. This push is a nearly impossible to react to “get-off-me-tool,” and if predicted right you can land an alpha immediately after pushing someone for some quick damage. However you are still extremely vulnerable when you do it and after if someone does dodge it. The push is really good for situations where you don't know where anyone is or want to know if you're safe to heal, as the pull will make the opponents scream while being pushed, showing you their proximity (the louder, the closer).

A small tip is to not immediately use Beta after a Gamma, because if you miss your pull  you will be stuck in the air for even longer and can be easily beamed or trapped in combos. The optimal play would be to pull, see if you actually pulled players, and if you did, then use Beta.

## Special Action - Plunder
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch016.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

By activating Special Action on a downed opponent you will finish them off and steal their quirk, taking all of their abilities and levels for yourself to use (you will NOT be able to use level cards on your stolen kit, it will remain at the same level as when you stole it), allowing you to swap to it and use for combat, movement, or other things. 
This is the fastest kill option in the entire game, barely taking 2 seconds to finish off an opponent and it gives you an entire other moveset to use in conjunction with your own that you can swap to and from as much as you want (within a set cooldown)
Note: You will receive only the Base 3 skills of the person you finish with your Special Action: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, so you won't be able to use other character's Special Actions like [Himiko Toga](https://ultrarumble.com/character/18) does.
You generally want to go after movement based quirks like [Mirio Togata](https://ultrarumble.com/character/24) or [Tsuyu Asui](https://ultrarumble.com/character/6), not damage oriented quirks like Strike Endeavor and Strike Shigaraki, since All For One has no mobility at all in his base kit. Stealing a Rapid character's kit will basically turn you into a 400HP Tank version of that character.
With that said, if you don't have a quirk you should steal the first one you can get your hands on. Regardless of what it is you will find it more useful to have a stolen quirk set than no other quirk set at all.
After the first one you can be more picky with your choices of quirks.
One mistake a lot of newer All For One players do is stealing every quirk they can get their hands on, you should be careful when stealing quirks since you can go from having a Level 9 Mirio Togata Kit to a Level 2 Tomura Shigaraki, and once you steal a new one there's no going back.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

In his Ground Melee, All For One uppercuts his opponent with his right hand, strikes them with his left hand, then performs a 360 spin before beating them away.
This move is surprisingly versatile; it has a basic power of 130 damage on its own, however he can combo off of its last hit with relative ease. After his final melee hit you can use many stolen abilities for big damage. His Melee also has great tracking on the first hit, so as long as you’re relatively close you will be able to hit opponents pretty easily. 


**Air Melee**<br>

All For One does an advancing strike mid-air. It has a decent hitbox and can start combos if it hits an opponent with GP, but is otherwise rather unremarkable for offense. However, the slight momentum can be used to manipulate your mid air movement when used in conjuction with movement quirks such as Tsuyu's. Not a tool to be relied upon.

## Leveling Paths

**The Basic:** this is the most common Levelling Path for Cementoss. It consists on levelling up Alpha to Level 9, followed up by  levelling up Gamma to this same level, leaving Beta for last. This route is based on mobility and will give Cementoss various movement options aswell as a lot of ranged attacks, at the price of not having a reliable big damaging move.
