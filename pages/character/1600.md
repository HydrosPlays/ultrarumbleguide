*The charisma of evil that steals Quirks from others. Use the various Quirks to lay waste to your enemies!*

All For One is a master of area control who specializes in creating death zones with his different moves. He can easily manipulate his opponent's positions or lock them down outright with his Beta and Gamma and finish off with great damage potential from his Alpha. He struggles in several areas such as mobility and long range engagements or fights in open areas, but he is able to work around these flaws with his Special Action, Plunder.</br>

## Alpha Skill - Final Blow 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch016_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

All For One releases a violent blast of air from his palm that damages opponents in his path, a simple yet effective attack that can be compared to that of most Beamer characters like [Izuku Midoriya](https://ultrarumble.com/character/1), [Shoto Todoroki](https://ultrarumble.com/character/4), etc.

By tapping the move you will release a blast of air that will knock down the opponent after they are struck 4 times, dealing solid damage in the process, but holding this Alpha for around 1.5s will make it get charged and release a much larger and powerful attack, with the downside of it being slower and taking up 2 charges instead of 1. This Charged Alpha has a unique property that makes it really useful, that being the ability to destroy any breakable structure with just one blow; Civillian Houses, Buildings, [Cementoss](https://ultrarumble.com/character/101) Structures and even things like Itsuka Kendo's Shield can be destroyed with just one Charged Alpha.



One thing to note is that you should not use Charged Alpha on someone who is far away unless you’re trying to sneak attack them and deal large amounts of damage in the process. Also when attempting to catch someone’s wake-up it is unwise to charge your Alpha, seeing as it has greater EndLag and a smaller hitbox than your Beta, which is extremely good at catching wakeups

## Beta Skill - Manipulative Claw
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch016_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

All For One extends his right fingers forward, catching any opponents in front of him in a cascade of chip damage. By tapping this move All For One will hit any opponent in front of him with up to 3 ticks of damage, and by holding this move All For One can hit an opponent with a maximum of 6 ticks before they are knocked to the ground. You usually want to hold this move to 5 ticks and then use an alpha for solid damage, and so you don’t stay in the air too long. All For One is at his weakest in the air, so holding beta midair until you knock everyone down is not a wise decision. 
This move could be considered one of the top 10 most useful moves in the entire game, since it can start combos, continue combos, end combos, catch wakeups extremely easily at mid-high levels and many other games. Adding to this, All For One's Beta also has the capability of going through walls, adding a lot more potential to this. Practicing predicting where your opponent is going to go to score even more damage, and potentially some kills, is recommended.
Something to note is that this move starts off rather small and poor: it covers almost nothing, not being useful the majority of the time unless you can get a guaranteed hit, like blocking a doorway. The risk of going for it is too heavy, and it's better to just alpha spam or disengage if you have a level one Beta. But the move becomes a massive and damaging AoE (Area of Effect) move at max level.

## Gamma Skill - Black Field
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch016_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

All For One activates his warping quirk, pushing or pulling every enemy within its vicinity towards or away from you. 
By holding until the move is finished charging All For One will suck in every enemy inside of his Gamma’s AOE. After pulling in enemies All For One can do a multitude of things, such as using Alpha, Beta, Melee, Air Melee, use stolen quirks, ... You can also use this to Pull downed opponents to finsish them off safely and quickly. On paper this move is fantastic because it can start All For Ones's most powerful combos and handle crowd control, however in reality it can be a double edged sword: it is extremely easy to roll and it leaves you extremely vulnerable while you’re pulling and if you fail the move. Activating this Skill in the air can be more useful than just using it on the ground, the opponents will be pulled in the air making it so much harder for them to get out of combos or escape the Storm.

By tapping or holding this move and releasing it early All For One will push every enemy in his gamma’s range away. This push is a nearly impossible to react to “get-off-me-tool,” and if predicted right you can land an alpha immediately after pushing someone for some quick damage. However you are still extremely vulnerable when you do it and after if someone does dodge it. The push is really good for situations where you don't know where anyone is or want to know if you're safe to heal, as the pull will make the opponents scream while being pushed, showing you their proximity (the louder, the closer).

A small tip is to not immediately use Beta after a Gamma, because if you miss your pull  you will be stuck in the air for even longer and can be easily beamed or trapped in combos. The optimal play would be to pull, see if you actually pulled players, and if you did, then use Beta.

## Special Action - Plunder
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch016.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

By activating Special Action on a downed opponent you will finish them off and steal their quirk, taking all of their abilities and levels for yourself to use (you will NOT be able to use level cards on your stolen kit, it will remain at the same level as when you stole it), allowing you to swap to it and use for combat, movement, or other things. 
This is the fastest kill option in the entire game, barely taking 2 seconds to finish off an opponent and it gives you an entire other moveset to use in conjunction with your own that you can swap to and from as much as you want (within a set cooldown)
Note: You will receive only the Base 3 skills of the person you finish with your Special Action: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, so you won't be able to use other character's Special Actions like [Himiko Toga](https://ultrarumble.com/character/18) does.
You generally want to go after movement based quirks like [Mirio Togata](https://ultrarumble.com/character/24) or [Tsuyu Asui](https://ultrarumble.com/character/6), not damage oriented quirks like Strike Endeavor and Strike Shigaraki, since All For One has no mobility at all in his base kit. Stealing a Rapid character's kit will basically turn you into a 400HP Tank version of that character.
With that said, if you don't have a quirk you should steal the first one you can get your hands on. Regardless of what it is you will find it more useful to have a stolen quirk set than no other quirk set at all.
After the first one you can be more picky with your choices of quirks.
One mistake a lot of newer All For One players do is stealing every quirk they can get their hands on, you should be careful when stealing quirks since you can go from having a Level 9 Mirio Togata Kit to a Level 2 Tomura Shigaraki, and once you steal a new one there's no going back.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

In his Ground Melee, All For One uppercuts his opponent with his right hand, strikes them with his left hand, then performs a 360 spin before beating them away.
This move is surprisingly versatile; it has a basic power of 130 damage on its own, however he can combo off of its last hit with relative ease. After his final melee hit you can use many stolen abilities for big damage. His Melee also has great tracking on the first hit, so as long as you’re relatively close you will be able to hit opponents pretty easily. 


**Air Melee**<br>

All For One does an advancing strike mid-air. It has a decent hitbox and can start combos if it hits an opponent with GP, but is otherwise rather unremarkable for offense. However, the slight momentum can be used to manipulate your mid air movement when used in conjuction with movement quirks such as Tsuyu's. Not a tool to be relied upon.

</p>

## Leveling Paths

**All For Beta:** It can't be stressed enough just how crazy of a tool beta at max level is. Therefore, it is actually a good idea to invest heavily into it in early game, which will allow you to easily lock down opponents at close to mid ranges while dealing huge damage.

</p>

**All For Combos:** An alternative to the first one, spreading levels across Alpha and Beta more equally, which will slow down Beta's progression in exchange for a stronger long range presence and the possibility of earning even greater damage when using Charged Alpha during combos and setups.

</p>

**Balance For One:** The balanced option. While you won't excel at any of his options, you will instead have a more versatile tool set during the early to mid game.

**All For Control:** Focused on disrupting enemy movement and lockdown, this option is particularly great if you are heavily looting/fighting in closed areas that facilitate the strengths of these moves.

## Techs

### Charged Alpha Maneuvers

Usually, when All For One is charging his Alpha, he will be have a really slow movement speed, which in this game can get you to take a lot of damage from attacks, even when you think you may be safe. Instead dash, jump and then immediately start charging your alpha. This will allow you to conserve the momentum from the run and move with more speed during the brief time you are mid-air. You can use this to reposition during a combo or tech chase.

### Alpha Roll Cancel

If you start charging an Alpha shot but decide you actually don't want to shoot or need to cancel (for example, if you see a huge AoE (Area of Effect) attack coming your way), you can execute a dodge in any direction to quickly cancel the move. 

### Quirk Switching Combos

With quick reactions, you can stun an enemy with a combo starter, swap to your stolen quirk and then execute aditional follow-ups, and vice versa. The specifics of which combos can be done will be detailed in each quirk's specific section. 

### Quirk Switching interactions with traps/installs

Traps or moves that remain on the field for a long time such as [Tech Denki's mines](https://ultrarumble.com/character/7#Variant-1) will linger on after All For One swaps back to his Default moveset. On the other hand, "install" moves such as [Recipro Burst](https://ultrarumble.com/character/5) or [Crazy Torch](https://ultrarumble.com/character/17#Variant-1)  will automatically cancel when you stop using the stolen quirk. The specific uses of these oddities will be detailed later on.
        
## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of All For One's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 164 DP both (Uncharged and Charged)<br>
Beta Skill: 84 DP per hit<br>
Gamma Skill: 0 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3: 100 DP (Individually), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is displayed from all skills at lowest level to all level 9.

## Pull Startup Combos:
Keep in mind that none of the combos listed here are exclusive to a Pull, it's just much easier to do them starting off with it. These Pulls are also assuming you're in the air when you do them, as you should be for the most part.

### Pull > Charged Alpha > Beta 3 > Charged Alpha:
Camera should be angled upwards for the first Alpha, otherwise the beta won't be able to connect.
This is not technically a true combo, as the opponent can air recover after the first Alpha (and will auto-recover on GP), but more often than not, you can just keep holding Beta and they'll fall into it anyways. Initial Alpha can be avoided by Mirio if you're even slightly off timing, so if he's the only one pulled, you might as well just do a Beta string. This is the highest damage base-kit combo at AFO's disposal.

</p>

### Pull > Beta 5 > Air Melee:
Good way to activate Melee tunings easily, that's it. <a href="https://ultrarumble.com/guide/character/10301">

</p>


### Pull > Air Melee > Alpha×2:
Slightly more scuffed version of the above combo, less reliable for a bit more damage. Activates Melee TUNING immediately rather than at the end of the combo (Making Embrittlement effective with it), opponents may be able to escape before the 2nd Alpha lands if their kit has the capabilities.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c11.png" width="400" />
</p>

## Push Startup Combos:
These can be hard to do consistently due to how wild AFO's Push can throw people, but it's free damage nonetheless.

### Push > Alpha:
Most consistent option. Simply shoot whoever you knocked back with an Alpha before they land on the ground and get their I-frames. Learning the timing and placement of the Alpha can take a bit but getting one in whenever you Push really adds damage over time. Possible to get 2 or 3 shots if they're falling for long enough.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c11-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c11.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Push > [Any Beta string]:
Very inconsistent. Requires a wall right behind your opponent so you're close enough to hit Beta, but even then, it only hits half the time.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c11-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c11.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Push > [Any Melee string]:
As expected, you have to have a wall right behind them, and be *right* next to the person to do this. As a result, it very, very rarely comes up as an option.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c11-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c11.png" width="400" />
</p>

## Beta Startup:
This is really where the damage comes from, most initial hits on people are gonna be from Beta, so learning how to combo off it is important.

### Beta 5 > Alpha:
Simplest and most consistent combo in AFO's kit, should always be done over just holding Beta. As mentioned in the Beta section above, there is almost no circumstance where it's better to hold a full Beta over ending it with something else.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c11-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c11.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta 5 > Charged Alpha:
This is a case by case basis on whether or not it should be performed. If your opponent is off the ground, then this is pretty much confirmed on every character (except Mirio), and is relatively easy to pull off. If your opponent is not off the ground, it's a bit riskier. Most people will roll as soon as they can, so it can be better to hold the Alpha a bit longer and just catch their roll with it. At high levels this does do more than enough damage for a guard break, so the pay off is often worth the attempt.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c11.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta 3 > Melee:
Slightly less damage than Beta into Alpha. Similar function to the Air Melee combos with activating Melee TUNING, but can be dangerous if done out in the open as it takes longer to perform and requires a closer proximity to the opponent. If they get hit at the very tip of Beta, the timing is tighter to run up and land a Melee, so try to remember how long the stun lasts.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
Strike Slots: tunes that buff All For One's Alpha and Beta damage can be really useful for combos.<br>
Assault Slots: tunes that buff his overall defense are esential, turning All For One, a bulky character with 400HP, even tankier. <br>
Rapid Slots: All For One doesn't benefit that much from these tunings, any cheap option can do the trick.<br>
Support Slots: same as Assault Slots; buffing his Health or Shields can make All For One even better. <br>
Technical Slots: while All For One can benefit from these tunes, they aren't as high priority as others. You should focus on Gamma reload and Special Action reload ones.<br>
### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>One of his best choices. With All For One being a level dependant character, getting double the level up cards paired up with the usual looting will allow him to get to max strength and start terrorizing the rest of the lobby much earlier, as well as guaranteeing he won't be dead weight if he dies early on and revives at a time where it will be impossible to loot easily.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br> All For One lacks mobility and he's usually seen as easy loot by characters who can catch up to him easily in Early Game. This tuning will give you the extra mobility you need to shake them off or outright escape, and it can also be used to aggresively engage or chase other players. An all-around excellent tuning that can also pair up nicely with other mobility quirks. Bonus points if you manage to steal an Iida quirk while using this; enjoy the recipro burst shenanigans.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br> Always a useful tuning, it will leave you with 1 HP and a hard knockdown when you are supposed to go down, which can buy you those few seconds you need for a team heal to go off or to get your plus ultra charged, or just give you a chance to slip away if you have a mobility quirk on you. At level 11, it is a free second chance at life every 60 seconds, a good pick altogether.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch105_00.png" width="125"> | **Trance Blow** <br> A particularly evil choice. The brainwashing effect makes opponents so mind-numbingly slow in EVERYTHING that, by using it as a combo ender, you can very easily loop them once they get up with Charged Alpha, and even get them with Gamma pushes/pulls. Monster tuning for 1v1s, definitely less potent on team fights or outright chaotic free for alls between different teams since you can only affect one person at a time, but overall, still a good pick. |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>Another great tuning for getting AFO's levels up early on, this one comes with the benefit that you won't necessarily have to fight people to make use of it, instead being able to sneak in Big Item Box openings to build yourself up. This works all the way to the End Game, where you will usually be able to collect the chest's loot since no one will usualy want to risk it in those moments. Still, be cautious of sneaky enemies (and sometimes teammates, really.)|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch018_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>This will make your combos hurt a lot more than they already do, especially when paired with other damage boosters. All For One has an easy time activating this tuning due to his melee being easy to set up from Beta and Gamma pulls, and the combos that lead to the activation do solid damage themselves, so you will be laying the hurt on your opponents with this.|

It also has good special tunes supporting Willpower/Revenge Strike and Card Duplication/GP Sucker, of which Willpower and Card Duplication are recommended.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-hero.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30"> |

The best use case for this fit is to act like the previous fit in many ways but it's recommended to only run it with Wall Runner and Revenge Strike, unless you don't have the previous skin, then you can use this fit with Card Duplication or GP Sucker and it will be almost as good.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-hero.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-villain.png" width="30"> |
